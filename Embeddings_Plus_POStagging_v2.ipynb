Unlike other thermos-type cups, this one actually keeps the beverage hot for quite some time, especially if you place the cap on it. The cap itself is really unique in the way it works. After filling with a hot liquid the cap fits rather loosely in place. But, after a few seconds heat expands it and it wedges itself in place very securely. You can still pry it off but not easily when it's hot which is just what you'd want. Also, that cap has a neat little sliding anti-splash tab on the top that actually works. The cup is wide enough to be stable sitting on a flat surface - with or without liquid in it - yet fits easily into a car tray cup holder for travel. After using the cup for a few days I decided that I didn't want the nylon handle. I simply used a heat gun (on low) to gently heat it up and just pulled it down and off of the cup. That handle is secured to the cup with some glue and a slight ridge running around its inner circumference. It was easy to clean off the remaining glue from the stainless steel and I could - if I wanted to - re-glue and reattach the handle. This is a great insulated stainless steel cup with or without a handle and well worth the price.Insulated stainless steel cup that actually works",1,11],[80000005,5.0,false,"A38NXTZUFB1O2K","0700099867","FiSH","I'm not quite finished with the game's DiRT Tour mode, but I believe I've experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer.  And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series. At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal. Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.  If you enjoy racing games, this is not one you should ignore.

Lew","I really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games.  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally 3 demo, which came before Dirt.  Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement, or maybe not.Dirt, Dirt 2, and Dirt 3",5,12],[80000009,5.0,true,"A1FZV5FWLJKYU7","1581174292","L.

As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new. This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing. PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support! CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube. I don't think CodeMasters wants to rip you off, but if it makes you uncomfortable, create a new Google identity for use with Dirt 3. Easy! -LEARN THE TRACKS. Learn the tracks, learn the tracks, learn the tracks. -If you want to win, employ a Fin!An overlooked gem in the Forza/GT treasure trove",2,3],[80000011,5.0,true,"A2CDLJU98TUNGD","1605160113","Rainestormrose","Only one back of the card was as shown on Amazon.

I'm not sure if he's running out of steam, or if the life stories of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee don't allow much development at this point.  The dense subplotting and evocative details about Navajo life, so evident in the best Leaphorn/Chee stories, are mostly missing here.  Hillerman seems to have been motivated mainly by a desire to wrap up the Jim Chee/Bernie Manuelito relationship, which he does, but not in a particularly original way.  If you are new to this series, try the books written in the 1980's to get a better sense of Hillerman's considerable talent; The Dark Wind is probably the best of the best.OK, but far from Hillerman's best",2,5],[80000025,5.0,true,"AJ3QKWL8CT3TT","1605160512","J.

The early books were traditional police procedurals set in the unique environment and society of the Navajo Reservation.  The crimes that led to murder were relatively small in magnitude: stealing Indian artifacts, robbing a casino, or revenge.  In recent Hillerman books, the crimes have grown in scope to encompass serial killing, international drug smuggling, and theft of billions of dollars worth of natural gas.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  The Sinister Pig seems closer to Ludlum that to early Hillerman. A CIA expert on middle eastern oil pipeline technology is murdered while on a freelance investigation for a US Senator in the Four Corners area.  Both Chee and the local FBI agent are quickly frozen out of the investigation by FBI headquarters.  Chee continues to probe for information with help from the retired Leaphorn, \"Cowboy\" Dashee (now a BLM law enforcement officer), and Bernie Manuelito who has joined the US Customs Border Patrol. As in Wailing Wind, Bernie is the pivotal character in the story.  Through her eyes Hillerman shows the reader how the US Government goes about trying to interdict illegal immigration and drug trafficking on the border with Mexico.  It is not pretty.  Chee is as inept as ever in dealing with his romantic interest in Bernie.  While there were genuine obstacles to overcome in Chee's earlier love affairs, his inability to make his true feelings known to Ms Manuelito seems merely callow. We know who the villain of the piece is almost from the outset.  He not only has the CIA agent killed, but arranges to have a young congrssional aide he has impregnated vanish.  Lacking the whodunit element, the reader has only suspense to fuel his interest. Hillerman's descriptive skill is as sharp as ever and his ear for dialogue as true.  Leaphorn is still Leaphorn.

It is another superb novel, and nearly on par with his other works. The Sinister Pig offers many characters familiar to  Hillerman's readers. Jim Chee continues to be a main focus, as does his prospective love interest, Bernadette Manuelito, now a novice customs officer working in southern New Mexico. Manuelito stumbles into trouble, drawing Chee and a host of others into the picture. Not the least of these others is the \"legendary\" ex-Captain Joe Leaphorn and his new \"sidekick\" character, Dr. Bourbonet. Several new characters - a Guatemalan exile, a Washington DC attorney and an erstwhile law student -- are particular to this story. Still, they're well-written and compelling, and extend the depth of the story past the usual boundaries of a mystery. As the story develops, the reader will notice a series of evolutionary departures from Hillerman's standard fare. Foremost among these is the fact that story reads less like a mystery than a suspense novel. While it's true that there is a murder, and it is something of a mystery, the good guys and the bad guys all have their identities and roles out on the table pretty early on in the book. From there, the reader gets to anticipate whether the good guys (Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and a few others) will find and capture the bad guys before they succeed in any of their nefarious plans. Since the reader knows how the pieces fit together before the characters, the story really revolves around the suspense, rather than the \"whodunit\" aspect of the plot. At the same time, some other changes seem to be brewing in Hillerman's writing. First, while Hillerman has always shifted points of view frequently in his stories, it seems like no point of view is particularly dominant in this book. From my recollection, that's a little different than in his earlier writing. Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and three major characters particular to this book all get some time in front of the point-of-view lens. It doesn't hamper the story, but for those used to watching Chee or Leaphorn solve a mystery, it's a little new. The other key difference is that much of this novel takes place off the Navajo reservation that's so familiar to Hillerman readers. While that doesn't hamper the story either, for me it left the novel with a very different feel. Prior works were well-steeped in Navajo (and sometimes Hopi) cultural flavor, and I enjoyed this aspect of his works. That flavor, for me, got largely crowded out by other story elements in this book. It didn't ruin the work, but I did find that I missed that content, and hope he returns to it in the future. Far from harming the work, these differences and changes simply present the story in a different light. Sinister Pig is an excellent novel, and well lives up to the expectations that Hillerman's readers have. I give it five stars for it's strong story, good characters and compelling tempo. I don't think readers, whether they've read Hillerman before or not, could be disappointed by this  book.Different, But Still Very Good",5,7],[80000071,1.0,true,"A2KGTIG05HRSAV","9629971372","Coasty","I was really mad that on the buying site it said it was made buy Sony and found out later it was made in China!

Bates","For the dedicated Hillerman reader, this latest may be disappointing.  We have become accustomed to excellent mysteries which are also anthropology lessons.  In almost if not every story of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, Tony Hillerman has presented his readers with lessons about many facets of the southwestern Native American culture, the problems this culture faces.  This novel is more a straight thriller, without significant overtones of cultural stress and adaptation.  The basic plot line does have a Native American connection.  It seems that the Department of the Interior is responsible for a trust fund for Native Americans.  The trust is where royalties and other payments for oil, gas, timber, and other sales from reservation lands are deposited so that the money can be used for the benefit of the tribes.  It also seems that tens of billions of dollars which should be in the trust are not, and there doesn't seem to be any explanation.  A senator hires a retiring CIA specialist in pipelines to investigate what is happening in the \"four-corners\" territory, especially as it related to activities of a billionaire recluse who may be dabbling in hard drugs as well as petroleum.  The implication is that the billionaire is diverting gas and oil from the pipeline and avoiding paying royalties-or anything else.  The covert investigator is found murdered on the reservation and Jim Chee is the investigating officer.  But the FBI claims jurisdiction, transfers case management to Washington, and then stonewalls.  Chee wonders why the apparent cover-up and keeps on digging.  Enough waves are made that DC people involved in investigating the trust fund situation wonder if there is a connection and ask Joe Leaphorn, now retired, to look into the case.  What follows is a very good thriller, with unlikely \"heroes\" and bad guys getting their just desserts.  The implications of Washington insider conspiracies are raised but never resolved; yet, while not quite up to Hillerman's stories which do have stronger cultural lessons, this is a very good book.

The amazing speed that he can spit out sentences is astounding. Really forces you to focus on what he is saying. Every song on this CD is different but they all have the entrancing beat. The song, \"Cleaning out my Closet\" is really touching and sad. Sure this is all explicit. But banning his music is like burning Beatle records or not allowing Elvis to move his hips on TV.

The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems. Sure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy. The random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot. The plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her. The plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits. The  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes. There  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat. I've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality.

This game redefined the role playing wheel, when it was released on PS1. It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game. The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc. The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use. The graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail. Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms. The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too. This game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well. If getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find. If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.

Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, \"Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before.\" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation.

Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2.

Hedges","This is a great paper towel holder overall, and is certainly a good value. This is the second of this exact model of paper towel holder that I have owned, and I bought this as a replacement for the first one. I had the first one for about eight years, and it finally broke, requiring replacement. The thing I like about this specific towel holder is the design (wall or under cabinet mounting is at your option) which allows the roll to be slipped onto the central retaining spindle without requiring support at both ends, making for a secure towel holder that will not allow the roll of towels to fly out of the holder which is common in some holders which retain the towel roll by pressure on opposite ends of the roll. Another nice feature of this holder is the slightly upturned end of the roll retaining bar to prevent the roll from slipping off the rod when towels are aggressively pulled off the roll, especially with one handed operation. Overall this has been a great paper towel holder. I gave this holder four stars for one reason only, which is that being exclusively plastic it is vulnerable to fatigue cracking of the mounting cylinder, which requires replacement of the unit. This is exactly what finished off my old unit (it cracked at the attachment flange area and was not repairable.) Nonetheless, for a unit of this cost, I am very pleased with the overall performance, appearance, and value of this paper towel holder and would recommend it without reservation.Flexibility in a Paper Towel Holder",6,3],[80000181,5.0,true,"A1XXFXNL0TDS5X","7229004187","Richardao","Well made and I use them as Colanders and as bowls to hold produce, fruit etc. A great buy.

It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform. \"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience. \"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met. There is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance. \"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64",5,9],[80000190,5.0,true,"A126UITDLSDYLY","7300019196","grlpeach","Does a great job heating up my large living room.

Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category. Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game. Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race. Fun: 8.5/10.

They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.

Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam. The concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some \"new\" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it. Some other pros- Being a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer. Almost always runs smoothly. Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play. Cheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack. Very colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later. A 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game. A seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet. The opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank. There are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play. Over all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods. The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior C&C releases. Worth about 4 stars but at this price it gets 5. ...............socksStill a fun game...TS v RA2?",4,2],[80000256,5.0,true,"A2YXSVQ168VL8O","0001381733","Ravenshade","We have a few other hard copies of this book but it was nice to get this on Kindle so we can easily take it along in the car or on vacation.

However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9). The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some.

I used about 9ft of the wire that came with the kit and I have several feet left. The description states that you need to supply your own fasteners/hardware, so unless this addition was just made to the item description, no one can complain about this. I bought some #12 1 1/2\" wood screws so that the heads fit into the pre-countersunk holes in the metal plates that you attach to the walls. One plate and three screws went into a stud and the other into a very smooth masonry wall with some Gorilla Glue. This Gorilla Glue works in *my* case - I must have put about 15 lbs of downward pressure on it and for *me* it was fine, especially since less than 3 pounds will be hanging from it. I hate drilling through masonry walls in a rented house, and so this alternative works fine for me. The fact that the installation instructions are all pictorial was not a problem, the assembly was easy. If you're used to putting things together yourself, this is a simple project. The hardest thing is positiong the wire plates at either wall exactly where you want them if no studs are present. I don't want the wire to sag, so I checked for stud locations *before* ordering this, knowing that I might also have to use masonry anchors and screws. If you can't attach this to wall studs, you might just want to go with ceiling curtain rod brackets ad a very lightweight curtain rod (all of which Ikea happens to have for a lot, lot less than Home Depot). If you want to be really cheap, twist two screw eye hooks into the wall studs (I hope they're directly opposite one another) and get some wire. But I do like the simple tension system with this set. The 17mm spacing they indicate you should use is good, especially if you're doing a long room and the wire tends to sag more during installation. With my 9ft room, I only needed about 10mm because my cut wire length was fairly tight to start. Better to cut off too little than too much - you can always cut more off later. A cordless screwdriver/drill and cutting pliers may be needed if you don't already have them.Easy to assemble, bring your own screws/anchors",6,2],[80000276,5.0,true,"A17PMBB2MNBQ9D","9177129520","Amazon Customer","Wonderful set of flatware.

In Goldeneye, you will encounter all of the characters and locations from the Goldeneye film, and the single player campaign holds its ground. But multiplayer is where the game really shines, and it is so much better than Timesplitters or Timesplitters 2 even. I have not played Goldeneye for over a year, but the music rings in my head and I have the levels memorized perfectly. Even if you worship your Perfect Dark copy, I believe that Goldeneye is better, and I have a strong debate on that. The bottom line is that Goldeneye is the BEST FPS EVER CREATED!! It boils down to this:if you own an N64, please play your Goldeneye copy or if you don't even know what this wonderful game is about, buy it now!

Forget a touchdown, this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards, with three interceptions and a dozen field goals. Nothing on a home console was even close to its league. And even today, in the afterglow of behemoths like Halo, Metroid Prime and a limitless roster of PC shooters, the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations. It's difficult to call any game \"perfect.\" No matter how original, how exciting, how breathtaking it may look, sound, play or feel, there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas, and Goldeneye is no exception. Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers. No lie, I've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish, known there's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from, and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers' attack. It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits' end. In addition, there's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way. Every once in a while, an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand, blankly staring, for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers' bullets couldn't pass right through him. So you'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man, a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him, all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body. Despite my small misgivings however, 99% of this game plays flawlessly. The progression of difficulty is astounding, moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart's conclusion. And it's all done while walking that razor's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving. The player realises these missions are possible, even as he's watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes. Add to all that three difficulty levels, cheats that must be unlocked with speed, precision and overall know-how, hidden stages and hidden characters. Not only do you have a legendary FPS, you've also found nearly limitless replay value. Goldeneye is more than just a very good game, it's the stuff legends are made of. It's a game you'll want to play with your grandkids years from now. Hands down, the most attractive part about Bond's N64 debut, even today, is its controls. The Nintendo 64 controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with 007's repertoire, as every button is in precisely the right place for its function. It truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. The center grip of the N64 controller seems to BECOME the handle of a silenced PP7, Bond's revolver of choice. The \"Z\" button is a perfect trigger, and if you've purchased a Rumble Pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire. Strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand, as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle. No control system has ever felt so immersive, so right. After the first level, you hardly recognize the controller is there, it's already become such an extension of your own body. I can't sing any higher a praise than that. If you've seen the feature film of the same name, you'll notice some eerie similarities. Everything, from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen. It's honestly unsettling, how well the level designers did their jobs. Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film? You'll get your chance to find the answer on the N64. It's an experience I can't really put into words, something I'd never seen before and haven't seen since. It's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption. Finally, there's the multiplayer aspect of 007. While the single-player mode is challenging, unique and groundbreaking, multiplayer is absolutely unreal. I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released, and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than I'd wish on anyone. There were literally lines leading into my room, just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action. It was an addictive community event, whenever that little red light on the front of our N64 lit up. Truly something special. With multiple modes of play, a handful of playable levels, some hidden surprises and dozens of options, you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice, and it didn't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold-hearted war. In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no-brainer, it's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field. Goldeneye blazed that path, and did so in style. It cleared out the weeds, flattened the hills, and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today. Truly, the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such. In short, Goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a Nintendo 64, even today. There's a charm about it that can't be described, a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay. It's got the look and feel of a legend, and that's exactly the word I'd use to describe it. While there are certainly flaws, this is a game you'll kick yourself for never owning in a few years, when it becomes increasingly difficult to track down.Buried Gold on the N64",3,12],[80000299,5.0,true,"A1YNH5K0EIHLD3","917712071X","A.Porto","Nice and Shiny, Right Now.

They're just so clunky, most of the time you can't tell where you're going, you don't know if an enemy is behind you, (Or at times even in front of you, if you get a weird camera angle) and plus might I add that you can't see your character, which does not really, (For me, most of the time) give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character.   Well, Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game.   I don't know why people complain about the graphics...it's actually kind of cool, and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they're real.  The scientists in the facility level are well detailed, and most all the characters are animated incredibly.   Besides, you take on the role of James Bond.  James Bond! The hero that defined action! This game is not dull, and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room.   The multiplayer mode, is, of course, wonderful.  You can choose from power weapons, sniper rifels, Dostovals, Shotguns, PP7's, proximity mines, hand grenades, laser guns, and basicly everything else that you can think of.  It is an entertaining game, and it is well worth the money.   The camera angles rock.  you never get lost.   So, why didn't I give this game Five stars?  Read below and find out.   THE BADS OF THE GAME   There are some major glitches.  You can see your enemies literally walk through walls, not completely, but almost there.   At times the doors, when I command it to open with the B button, it still won't open, even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place.  The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well, but how am I supposed to know that? So, I stand back, the enemy comes in, and oh, guess what, it turns out that there isn't just one of them, there's thirty, so they all shoot at me, and I die.  You can easily die in this game just due to glitches, which makes it very difficult and frustrating.   If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again.  You don't just do the thing you forgot, either, you have to do all the things that you did do, as well as the things you did not.   The game is predictible, due to the fact that it follows the movie, although when it does not follow the movie, (Which it does a lot) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.   The puzzles can be frustrating.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.   The game is also very gory.  I don't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature...it should of been rated mature.   Now, for the GOODS of this game.   GOODS   Use an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry...prepare to save the world, it's gonna be a rough ride.   It follows the movie really well, (Most of the time, anyways) And if you're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game.  Even if you aren't you'll still enjoy it.   You play the role of james Bond, which is worth it within itself.   This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N64.  The controls aren't so difficult that you'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you're losing, but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun.  And even if you don't like the controls, you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen.   There's nothing that you can't shoot or destroy.   The cheats are FUNNY!  I mean, honestly, try the invisibility mode. You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near, and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that.  This makes the game easier also, and the invincibility mode is good too, although I tried and realized that you can't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time.  You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff, which is really funny to see.   The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie...they look exactly like the actors.   At the end of every level, it tells you how many kills you did, how many limb shots, how many head shots, and how many body shots you had.   The artificial intelligence with the badguys aren't all that challenging, but when there's a whole crowd of them, watch out!   This game is excellent.  Did I mention that it's excellent?

The first story, \"I can lick 30 Tigers Today\", talks about \"licking\" but in reference to \"beating up\" which is not how most people use the word \"licking\" anymore. The lesson is certainly still applicable: be careful not to over promise what you are capable of, or to not bite off more than you can chew. However, parents might need to explain the alternate meaning (not that small children aren't already putting everything in their mouth as it is...).

Lots of people extol the graphics in GoldenEye, but graphics in Mario Kart 64 is better. First of all, it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better. The gameplay is simple, but that only means it's easier to learn. The card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing. So the characters don't say much. It's mainly just a simple \"Yippee!\" or \"I'm-a Wario and I'm-a gonna win!,\" but there's much more in-game speech than GoldenEye. Sound effects are fine too. The soundtrack is excellent. It ranges from coutry to smooth jazz. Even some major critics of video game music I know have said that the music here is great. You know Koji Kondo's doing something right hearing that. Mario Kart 64 is addicting with four players, and it can be addicting with one player too. The Time Trials may be a little disappointing, but the Mario GP had me coming back for more. The game is one of the best racing games on the N64. It's better than WaveRace, Diddy Kong Racing, F-Zero X, and even Excitebike 64. Heck it's one of the best games on the N64!

The title caught my eye, and the cover showed the silhouette of a castle and a quote from Ursula Le Guin: \"A bitter, complex, brilliant book.\" Well, I thought, I'm bitter, complex, and brilliant, so this just might be for me.  So I plunked down my eighty-five cents and took it home, never knowing it was a cult novel that would challenge me like few others. There's three interwoven stories, each in the same location. The first and central story is a romance between two teenagers in 1973 England, with one going off to college. The kids are wistful, honest, confused, very intelligent, and trying to hold onto the one thing they know is sure in the world. They stood in the shelter of the tower, holding each other, rocking with gentleness. \"I love you,\" said Jan. \"I'm coming to terms with it.\" \" - love you.\" \"But there's a gap.\" \"Where?\" \"I know things, and feeling things, but the wrong way round. That's me: all the right answers at none of the right times. I see and can't understand. I need to adjust my spectrum, pull myself away from the blue end. I could do with a red shift.\" The second story focuses on a small band of the lost Roman Ninth Legion trying to blend in with the first century tribes of Britain. Religion, subversion, and revelation rise among the brutality of war. One of them, Macey, is prone to berserker-like fits. Anyone who likes military fiction, or gritty fantasy, will appreciate the realistic depictions of their battles, all laced in Vietnam-like delirium. \"You and Magoo stand sentry,\" said Logan, \"but listen. All of you get this, and get it good. The guards have been taken out, maybe not by Cats. The Mothers have come south. They'll raid the Cats wherever they find them, and both sides will whip our ass if we let them. Solutions.\" \"The usual,\" said Face. \"Divide and rule. Hit the infrastructure.\" \"Correct. All right? We retreat until we're clear of the Mothers, then we go tribal.\" The third story takes us to St. Bertoline's church, in Barthomley, 1643, when the Irish are invading the countryside. It's much like \"The Crucible\" in terms of a love triangle mixed with religious fervor, and it ties in with the other stories with a stone artifact that appears throughout the novel. A single bell began to ring over the parish. \"Is it church time already?\" said Margery. \"No. My father. He thinks we'll be up against reasonable men.\" \"Have you seen them?\" \"Nearly. I rode down through Crewe by Oak Farm. They'd not left any alive. I must go and stop that bell. They'll find us soon enough.\" There's profound connections between these characters I won't reveal here, but the novel weaves questions of identity, time, and the bond between the three couples to the point where the book doesn't always mark where one scene ends and another begins. Early editions were marketed young adult, and yet it's as adult and dense as a Salinger story or Shakespeare. The novel ends on a heartbreaking note, leaving you in wonder as to what exactly happened, and yet that's exactly the charm and strength of the work - like rich poetry, you need to read it more than once to get all the meaning, and even then there's much beyond your reach. It's a challenging work, and at a scant 120 pages, maintains the tension all the way through. For readers outside England, here's some pointers on British words: a caravan is a military trailer, nesh is being very sensitive to cold weather or simply lacking courage, a folly is a castle built for decoration, cans are headphones, M6 can be both a highway and a star cluster, M33 is a spiral galaxy, and \"Tom's a-cold\" is from \"King Lear.\"  Also, image searches of Crewe and Mow Cop would give an idea of the setting, but don't read the Introduction or look up the meaning of the coded message until you've finished the book. To sum up, captivating and cryptic, with realistic, unique characters and situations, all presented with a masterful use of mystery and suspense. Add to that spell-binding dialogue, rich with layer on layer, and it's a work that resonates with you long after.Challenging, Grim, and Compelling",1,2],[80000344,5.0,false,"AJBFQP2JXBX6Q","0001841572","John Bonavia","A bitter, dense, vigorous book about the violence and betrayals we inflict on each other.  So much is lost along the way - and although there is some survival at the end, what kind of survival is it? There are three interwoven stories, spanning three points in time and one in space - the times are the later Roman Empire in Britain, the British Civil War of the 17th century, and the modern age.  The space is a part of Cheshire around an iconic hill, Mow Cop. And the three are linked - apart from their biting emotional motifs -  by an object, a prehistoric axe head, that appears in all, a talisman of the ages. In the earliest thread, a ragged remnant of a Roman legion - just a few soldiers, conscripts from who-knows-where - have to deal with the wild and ancient tribes, as vicious and crafty as the soldiers. Wonderfully, Garner has made them talk the lingo of modern squaddies, because that's how they would have sounded to each other. In the Civil War, villagers take refuge in a church from the prowling band of enemy - but not all the hatred is political...In today's world, a near-genius innocent, a sacred fool (who quotes Lear's lines for Tom the fool) is paired with a girl above his social level and distrusted by his parents: there are no swords here, but \"words\" is an anagram of \"sword\" and the pain is the same. Incredible tight, elliptical exchanges: you may have to read a page twice to \"get\" everything that is happening (and then you won't be sure).

From the amazing graphics (for what it is; a N64 game), to the music, to the challenging gameplay, to the engulfing storyline, the \"Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" is a must-play for any age. You start the game off as young Link (or whatever you want to call him), who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old. Inside the forest, there is a godly tree, who could be considered to be infinitly wise. The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising, and tests him to the dungeon inside of him. Link comes out, sucessful, and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising. From then on, you play young Link, and must overcome many obstacles. As a child, there are 3 dungeons, and the tree's counts as one, so you're making some time, right? WRONG. There's much more to this game then beating dungeons. As a child, you can't acess as many of the things, but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword, many of these things are then open to you. As a child, you got an ocarina, in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things. Now, you can do all those things, and more. My personal favorite is Epona's song, in which you place a horse's (Epona) song, and it comes to you, in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast. As a child, you have weapons like a stick (whoopey), a sword, a shield, a sling-shot, and Duku Nuts. As an adult, you can handle 2 swords: the Master Sword, and the Giant Sword, which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands, which means no shield. You also have the hook-shot, Megaton Hammer, bow-and-arrows, and magic crystals you can do different things with. I cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is.

As you may have heard, I am definitely NOT a fan of the very first Crash Bandicoot game released for the Sony Playstation in 1996.  I am, however, incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never-ending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 1998. Just so you know, I can't compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back because I haven't played that one.  I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot. Before playing Crash 3, I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game.  I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off, and didn't deserve all the attention it got. For 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew, and truth be told, it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring, repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage. Simply put, Crash's very first outing was BORING.  It desperately needed variety.  Walking through island/jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring.  The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite- Warped features nothing BUT creativity.  In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel.  You will encounter something drastically different in every stage.  I like that. The main objective of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game.  You HAVE to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game won't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you're in.  For example, if you're in World 4, and can't find the purple gem in stage 3, you won't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world.  You're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem.  Once you find the gem, and face and defeat the boss, you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss.  By the way, there's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world.  That comes to 25 stages total. The amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible.  Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground, Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety.  In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages (where you're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem), a couple underwater stages (with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly, puffy fish swimming about), a couple levels where you're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes, and not to mention those tricky, tiger-riding stages. Oh, and I HAVE to mention the ultra-cool futuristic robot stages (which require near-perfect jumping patterns in order to complete).  The Jet Ski stages are really fun because you're located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs.  Yup, it's awesome.  This is what makes Crash Bandicoot 3 so great- you won't know WHAT to expect until you enter the level. Probably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge.  That's not to say the game is a cakewalk, either.  People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games.  If you compare Warped to say, I don't know, Spyro the Dragon, it's not such an easy game then.  It's definitely not a hard game either.  You WILL beat it.  I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros. 1, the old NES classic. The one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World 3 where you're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction.  This is one case where practice doesn't necessarily make perfect.  Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you don't bother shooting down the enemy planes. One thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems.  Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems, because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage.  I mean, they are always RIGHT THERE.  RIGHT in front of you! After you complete a stage, you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time.  Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard.  It means you *really* have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin-attack an enemy or ANYTHING.  It means you have to run run RUN!  Just so you know, completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement.  It's entirely up to you if you'd like to accept the challenge.  I'm too much of a wimp to accept it, personally. I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage.  You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room, if you wish.  Very convenient.  Oh, and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation, when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there!  I can't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect.  Speaking of lives, they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them.  That's a lot, and you will probably need them because, even though the challenge ranges from low to medium, your first time through the game won't be THAT simple. When Crash gets hit or smashed by something, I think it's funny the way he yells \"whoa!\"  It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top. The reason Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped isn't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon- in the flying stages (in this case, the airplane stages) when you hit down on the D-pad the airplane flies UP, and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN.  The game company made the direction the wrong way!  Oops.  At least when you steer the airplane left, it will go left.  The same with right.  Unfortunately, many game makers have made, and continue to make, the same mistake.  It needs to be corrected once and for all. I realize having your airplane fly up when you hit \"down\" on the d-pad is an example of realism since that's more or less how REAL airplanes operate, but the thing is, Crash Bandicoot isn't supposed to be about realism since it's just a platform adventure game, and furthermore, it still doesn't change the fact that up and down are reversed.  This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards. There's a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge, and in my mind at least, having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge. I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time.Crash's best game",2,8],[80000391,5.0,true,"A3FZF610C2PGJZ","0001712764","Amazon Customer","My 4 year old really enjoyed!Love!",6,12],[80000392,4.0,false,"AA50ZQDY2TPK5","B00000DMAR","Aaron","Crash Bandicoot: Warped = Orange, cool, creative, fuzzy, neat, great graphics, awesome design, introduction of secret levels for the series, power-ups, new bosses (including a big boss), and a new playable character.

It's a classic, no Mario fan should be without it. Now, onto the reveiw: Controls:9.5/10 It's pretty good compaired to some games, but most games have much smoother control. But since this is one of the first N64 games, I'm going to give it a good rating considering there are no PS2s, GCs, or Xboxs. There's mario's famous jump, double jump, and triple jump. The double and triple jumps can be performed by timing when you press the A button. There is also the groundpound aka buttstomp and other confusing jumps. Also, Mario can pick up and throw various items, climb walls using the wall jump,and punch and kick. The reson why this game's getting a 9.5 is because some jumps can be hard to master, and controlling Mario can sometimes be hard. Graphics:10/10 Like I said:This is one of the first Nintendo 64 games! So, it's okay that the graphics are a little blocky and not very detailed. The graphics are very well done. Replay Value:7/10 The point of the game is to retrieve all of the castle's power stars and save princess Peach. There are 120 in all. You only need 70 to beat the game. Sure, it's fun to go back and beat the game a couple more times. But how much time are you going to spend getting all 120?Some stars are very hard to get, and after a couple of times, you might get frusterated and just give up! Overall:10/10 Super Mario 64 is a brilliant game. Mario can be turned into metal Mario, invisible and fly by wearing special caps that last a certain amount of time. He can shoot from cannons and swing Bowser around by the tail. The courses are cleverly designed, everything is almost perfect. I use the word \"almost\" because nothing is perfect.Mario goes 3D",6,10],[80000445,5.0,true,"AFKVTC6NDI2B6","B0000224M6","Amazon Customer","Love themFive Stars",2,3],[80000446,5.0,true,"A1YUS3CIEEBDCQ","0001720392","Charlotte Blyther","gave to my grandson he is learning how to readFive Stars",7,2],[80000447,4.0,true,"A1HRYNC4I8D1ET","B0000224M6","masharra","When this arrived it was only a single pack with 8 wipes in it although it is listed as a pack of 3.

It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series, it hits video gaming gold.  From the earliest release of the original \"Super Mario Brothers\" on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, it has always been a hit.  Even lesser known titles in the series, like \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\", stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay.  With the dawn of Nintendo's three dimensional, 360 degree rotating platform, Nintendo 64, the question became, \"Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle?\"  The answer, in the form of \"Super Mario 64\", proved to be a quite emphatic \"YES!\" \"Super Mario 64\" takes the technique of 'multiple goals' for each level (introduced in \"Super Mario World\") and expands it in a quite impressive manner.  There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle.  The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser.  As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle, it would seem to be a walk in the park.  However, all is not as it seems.  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements.  Therefore, there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won.  Of course, this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean, soars in the open sky, battles over scorching lava, and even gets to sneak through a haunted house.  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing, as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals.  No longer content to just move forward and jump, Mario can now do backflips, long jumps, wall leaps, and crawls. One other aspect of \"Super Mario 64\" that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario's movements through each world.  It takes some getting used to, but it enables a truly three dimensional feel.  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around.  It delivered magnificently then and, with its continual replay value, still delivers today.Mario soars in a 3D world",3,9],[80000449,5.0,true,"AMMYOLKH0AAIV","B0000224M6","Queen","Smells nice!

I enjoy playing my copy of the game, and still find new interest and challenges of running cities.  The replay value should be obvious as there is no \"end goal\" to meet, though there are \"rewards\" along the way.  There are several problems, however, particularly when compared to Sim City 2000.  First, there are no scenarios.  That is a pity because the scenarios often enhanced the value of the game.  Second, you cannot for your own landform in the New City mode before you start the game (again, unlike SC2000).  Both of these problems were later corrected for the later cousin of the game: Sim City 3000 Unlimited. Additionally, the online support is much better for Unlimited.  The building downloads on the official website are minimal, and the building design tool is not supported by the basic game.  Still, I will have to admit that 3000 is still a vast improvement over the previous version.  The buildings are better designed, and they really do look different on different sides.  Also, the graphics are much better over 2000, while they are not vastly improved in Unlimited (which is essentially the same game, with the additions above AND additional buildings).  I would recommend that you do buy Unlimited over this version simply because of the vast number of updates.  And, with the release of Sim City 4, it is highly unlikely that even the Unlimited website will stay up much into the future, and it certainly will not be supported any more.Not Well Supported",5,4],[80000457,4.0,true,"A10XROX6G3HAGQ","B0000224M6","Sara F.","The nose was a great addition to the teddy bear I made for my daughter.

What You Should Know Before You Buy:  Attractive looking and nice quality silicone spatula set that worked well overall.  Each spatula has a one piece style with a sturdy handle and silicone covering the entire spatula.  There were essentially no seams.  Has two different size standard shape Spatulas and a large Spoonula (spatula/spoon combo).  Silicone heads were safe to use with our T-Fal non-stick pans.  Spatulas were fairly easy to clean, but scrambled eggs did stick a bit and had to be brushed for cleaning after sitting for an hour. Conclusion: Overall, this is a nice 3-piece silicone spatula set. It has a nice style and a quality build.  They were constructed to be a single piece for each spatula with silicone covering the entire utensil. I tested it out on various foods and they did quite a nice job. They worked well and cleaned up pretty easily, but did need a little scrubbing for some stuck on scrambled eggs that I used the spoonula for. I love a spoonula shaped spatula for eggs because it allows for scraping with the flat edge, but also allows for scooping out of the pan.

It is hard to even label him as a children's author, because adults love his work as well. We just use our kids as the excuse to buy the books! Green Eggs and Ham is certainly one of his classics that has been enjoyed by several generations of readers and it is easy to see why. His books are fun to read and look at. The characters start in a simple setting but quickly progress into some silly adventure in a world that only Seuss could come up with and make so enjoyable for others. The rhyming flows wonderfully and it is fun to read out loud and play with pace of voice. Kids giggle and ask for more. Those who can't yet read, still like to look at the pages and do their best to from memory. Green Eggs and Ham aces the entertainment factor. I almost gave it 5 stars. Even now, it feels somewhat sacrilegious to take it down to only four stars. It feels wrong in the way some people feel about a kid not being allowed to eat candy on Halloween. It's fun, shouldn't I just enjoy it? Maybe, but I am going to be a stick in the mud instead. We try to teach our kids that no means no and that peer pressure is bad. This book does not honor that. Sam is like the salesman that won't take no for an answer. He keeps pushing and pushing to close the deal. He does not let up when the other person starts getting angry. Finally, he gets him to break and try what he is offering. He doesn't just like what Sam gives him, he loves it. And that is another lesson we often try to teach. You won't know if you like it unless you try it. That is what I tell my kids about healthy foods. But that lesson is certainly not more important than the others. Sam was told no and he should have left it at that, allowing the other guy to come around on his own. I know it seems like such a minor thing, but our kids are listening. They find this book fun and a lot of kids also find it fun to pressure other kids to like what they like and do what they do even if the other isn't comfortable with it. Definitely read this book with your kids. Have fun with it, celebrate the genius of Seuss, and then simply explain to them that we should respect other people's choices.No Means No and the Matter of Peer Pressure",4,9],[80000496,5.0,false,"A1KW49KJL5B6VX","B0000224M6","Bryan Peterson","This is a must have for any red wine drinker!

Each level are unique from each other, and I must say that they include a lot of beautiful textures; they range from an underground arena, to skycrapers.  Using the sophisticated weaponry with advanced techniques will keep you glued to your screen; you get to retrieve weapons you see that appear, and use them for your enemies.  As for sound, the SFX is a little over average, it isn't as detailed or spectacular.

There's nothing special about it at all. I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same. For WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game. WCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space. The only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match. It goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much. Basically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault. Nitro and Backstage Assault weren't all that good but any following WCW game is 1000x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The WorldWorst WCW Game Ever Made",3,6],[80000503,5.0,false,"A8XK1O945GR0C","B0000224M6","Ryan T","Good light for my daughters room.

The replay value is so incredibly high it never seems to get old.  The graphics maybe out dated but the play control is excellent.  The music is very good and the stages are excellent each with its own unique features.  Once you learn the freeze sequence you can tee off on the competition.  The game is great as a single player and even more fun with multiple people.  The intro and endings are fantastic very well done.  TM2 improves on the first game in every way. I have spent countless hours playing the game, swearing at my TV and coming back for more.  I love the no holds barred aspect of the game every car vs every other car.  Who doesn't love blowing up Sweet Tooth or Twister.  Each character had their own unique abilities advantages and disadvantages.  There are so many ways to destroy your opponents and it is very satisfying to get revenge on someone who just blew you up. The challenge for the game was very even and as the player you always feel like you have a chance to win the round.  The sequels for Twisted Metal never seemed to capture the fun aspect or outstanding play control in this game. I think the only flaw in the game was that there was not enough lives to play simultaneously against the computer with no passwords and limited continues.  The first player game is fabulous I would rate that a 10. TM3 & TM4 all had the same flaw, the cars seem to gang up on you and not fight each other where as in this game it is full on mayhem going on the whole time.

It was the first in it's time.  The first game to have actual 3-D characters, rather than the suposive 3-D design that \"Doom\" and \"Duke Nukem\" bragged about their choppy, cardboard design.  Now that the movie of \"Resident Evil\" is out, kids and teenagers will be rushing out to buy the RE games.  For an aparent reason, the original RE isn't being sold anymore, rather that it's very, very rare and probably costs around 70 to 80 dollars.  Instead, they're is the Director's Cut. The DC is a odd version of RE that most people will be mistaking by the name.  No, it isn't more gorier, and no, Deleted Scenes not included; seriously.  Originally, the DC version had a much more explicit graphic beginning, with blood and all.  But due to censorship and problems with young kids bying M-Rated games and watching R-Rated movies, the scenes were cut out.  The only real different thing about the Director's Cut is the different costumes availible and items are in different spots. This will leave already RE owners high and dry, while satisfying non-RE game owners.  Anyways, the story. In RE, a group of Special tactics commandos, known as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) are dispacthed to a secluted mansion in the middle of a remote forrest.  The mansion once harvested top secret government experiments, lead by a Evil Corporation known as \"Umbrella\".  After the first squad, Bravo Team, was shot down from their helicopter and diseapeared without communication.  The second squad, Alpha Team, was sent to rescue them.  But a few scuffles with unknown creatures, leads their helicopter leaving them in the middle of the forrest.  In panic, the team finds refuge in the mansion. But little does the team know is that their troubles just begun.  You have the choice to either play Chris Redfield, a ex-marine turned SWAT commander, or Jill Valentine, a strong guided commando with the ability to pick lock doors and locks.  Through out the game, you must survive in the mansion. Your enemies are Bio-infested Zombies....that's right, zombies.  The problem; you're running low on ammo.  The story goes together, much like the basis for Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn\" or George Romeo's \"Night of the living Dead\".

So, when an old connector breaks, you have to throw away the old connector and the old metal bracket and replace it with this new bracket.

I'm looking forward to his latest video game installment, Crash Tag Team Racing.  The game's graphics are good, the gameplay itself sounds amuzing, and the trailer (on GameSpot) prove how visually stunning it's going to be too.  But, Crash's humble beginning is not the same as Mario and Sonic's were.  It was much better, more creative, and bigger. Mario's was just an arcade game.  It was hard, but it didn't take to long to master it, and I don't even know if there was a boss.  Sonic's debut was better then Mario's.  A game you could play without spending money, good levels, challenging, better bosses, and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary.  But, these debuts lacked what Crash's had.  Most challenging, best bosses, better secret ending, and most of all, a 3-D world to play in. Crash's world is not fully 3-D in this game (in fact up till Crash Twinsanity, none of them have been), but it is very good as far as it goes.  The VIRTUAL world looks like the REAL world.  That's one of the game's strongest points.  The controls are very solid and Crash responds amazingly well to your commands.  This spoiled me.  I'd play a Crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response.  I became versatile after a while though.  Crash lacks moves in this game, but he has more then Sonic and/or Mario had in their debut games.  Crash has 3, Mario and Soinc only had 1.  Crash's moves are running, jumping, and spinning.  The spinnig move is an extremely creative thing.  To make up for Sonic's spin, Naughty Dog brought out the bigger and better guns.  Crash's spin is much easier to control and is much more effective.  It also doesn't threaten you in a strange, almost indescribable way.  Sonic's spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning.  Sega called this the spin dash.  This could throw you to your death.  Not Crash's.  Crash could move or stay still when spinning.  Note: Soinc didn't have the spin dash in his debut game.  Mario and Sonic's jumping, I'll admit, was better.  They were tighter then Crash.  Their direction could be changed much, much easier then Crash when jumping.  Crash jumps higher though.  Crash runs kind of slow, especially when you need to get something done. But he's slower in Crash Twinsanity.  Crash's camera control is hardly ever a problem.  Every once in a while you'll have to strain your eye a little, but it's still a better camera then Soinc's.  Mario's is best out of all, though, 'cause you could see the entire level all at once. As for the other features of the game, they're pretty outstanding.  The levels are big and challenging.  There's also secret levels in Crash.  I've never seen anything like that in Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, have you?  No, I didn't think so.  Crash's biggest flaw is the saving system.  In the game, you must collect 3 tokens of Crash's girfriend's head (hidden in the level) to get to a bonus area.  You must get to the end of the Tawna (Crash's girlfriend's name is Tawna) Bonus Round, touch Tawna (who's just standing there), and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save.  If you don't do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save, you don't get to save. Not fair at all.  But, it's still better then Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, 'cause you can't save at all in those games.  There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game, The Cortex (main bad guy of the game) Bonus Rounds and the Brio (Cortex's right-hand man) Bonus Rounds.  You can't save in these bonus rounds, even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms.  Oh and get this, there aren't Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels, so you don't have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and you're in a level like Hog Wild where there's no bonus rounds.  Big flaw.  The 2nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems.  In the game you must collect 32 (I think; don't quote me on that number, because I'm not sure) gems in order to see the secret ending.  However, it's a little too hard to collect them all.  I understand most people think the game's not hard enough, but I think it's a little too hard.  To collect a gem, you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life.  I'm all for destroying every crate, but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem.  It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes. So, if you're wanting to compare Mario and Sonic to Crash, I'd say Crash all the way.  And, as you can see, if you're reading this, Crash's 1st game was much better then Mario and Sonic's.  I say Crash is best, no matter what anyone else tells me.My Favorite",5,7],[80000597,5.0,true,"A1T9KWJ3SSLYYP","B00002N5ZJ","Nancy W.","Works great for my 40 year old canner.Five Stars",1,9],[80000598,5.0,true,"A45HC4DHL0X4A","B00002N5ZJ","Jeff A.

Spyro is the main character(obviously) a little purple dragon with Sparx(a dragonfly and his best friend) following him around, Sparx represents Spyro's health and proctects Spyro. He can only take so many hits or damage spyro should of recieved before Spyro is on his own and can only get hit once, to avoid this however you can ram or flame the sheep(called fodder) and they will turn into butterflies which Sparx eats in one bite for a life. The mission of the game is to free your fellow dragons who were all turned to crystal statues(Spyro wasn't tall enough to get hit by the spell), get the eggs and dragon treasure back, and beat Gnasty Gnorc who hates dragons and besides turning them into statues stole all the dragon treasure and the dragon eggs.Spyro",1,5],[80000609,5.0,false,"A3AZW3V0E76VN9","0001720392","Room207","Green eggs and ham by Dr. Suess is a rhyming book about Sam trying to convince someone to eat green eggs and ham.

Resident Evil 2 showcases just why the series became big, and why Resident Evil is the leader of the Survival-Horror genre by a landslide. \"Resident Evil 2\", was just full of new ideas.  The 2 discs, and the 2 people to play as, where each of their actions affect the other person's adventure, for example was just amazing. I'm also not kidding when I call this game a \"scare\".  \"Resident Evil 2\" will have you on the edge of your seat, and it may even have you wetting your trousers a bit at certain times. \"Resident Evil 2\" is an essential pickup for any fan of the Survival-Horror genre.  \"Resident Evil 2\" did so much for the genre, that it shall be  remembered forever.A Classic Scare",1,1],[80000620,4.0,false,"A3SNO7AAYOXQUN","B00000I1BJ","Avatar of the Llama","My first experience with the Resident Evil series was with Code: Veronica X.  I was severely disappointed overall with it, and from what I've read, the whole series is the same, so I had little to no faith in it.  I didn't feel the need whatsoever to play the other games, and openly spoke out against the series, even though I only played one game.  But, after playing Resident Evil 4, I got intrigued by the story, so I decided to try out Resident Evil 1-3.  I thought, \"There's no way they can be worse than Code: Veronica, so why not?\"  And good god... was I right. Although the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke (thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code: Veronica X look like an Oscar-winning performance), that wasn't really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture, the second iteration really blew me away.  Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I don't care at all about graphics in a videogame, so I'm not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant (which is why I'm not a GameCube or Xbox fan).  The gameplay is very good for a survival horror - there is plenty of puzzle solving, adventure, exploration, and combat to keep the interest level up.  That's what I like about survival horror: it's not just about fighting to stay alive, but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances.  And, while Resident Evil 2 isn't anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series, it is still a top-notch game to play for any fan of the genre, and I highly recommend it.  The first one you can play on your own; I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him, and vice versa.  The reason the title of my review is \"I was wrong...\" is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyone's time.  So, I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk. But, there is one issue I just can't stop from addressing: the controversy over the control scheme.  Now, I won't go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody, but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view.  The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way.  This is a genre for puzzle solving, plotlines, exploration, and thought, not just about shooting things.  They made the controls this way to render it, in a way, a sort of \"anti-action\" type of game genre.  Still, though, once you get used to the controls, like me, you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough. Another thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their... \"creative\" death sequences (okay, so maybe they die a second time, but this time for good).  Naturally, you can blow their heads off, but even more possibilities await your execution.  Sometimes, you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets, or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half, the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you.  When you upgrade your shotgun later on, you can actually blow their chest in half!  And, with a rocket launcher, if you fire at them square in their torso, their arms, head, and a good portion of their upper body will be gone.  If you hit them to the right side, most of said side will be gone, as will their head and respective arm, yet their left arm will still be attached.  Pretty cool, huh?  Code: Veronica X didn't have anything like that, which is rather too bad. The only problem I had with this game, and it really isn't a problem with the game itself, is that it really made me shake my head at Code: Veronica X.  It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogame-making abilities.  Heck, even the first Resident Evil is better than REC:VX.  For example, in the first one, the hunters had narrow, sharp, reptilian eyes, rows of razor-sharp teeth that protruded from their mouths, and they looked pretty scary, but in Code: Veronica, they didn't have such teeth (it almost looked like they didn't have any at all), and they also had small, beady eyes, making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy. Yet another good part about this game is the Titan.  I must say, he is really one heck of a bad guy.  But, of course, he's nowhere near as bad*ss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head.  But he's cool nonetheless. So, in conclusion, if you like survival horror games, then I suggest you try this one out.  But don't expect it to be better than Silent Hill, if you're a fan of that series (just as a side note).I was wrong...",2,1],[80000621,5.0,false,"A2582KMXLK2P06","B00000I1BJ","Bryan","Now THIS is how you're supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody, violent game!  Blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies.  It's so strange and relaxing to experience this.  I know you will laugh at what I am about to tell you, but I never bothered with this game when it first came out.  Yeah, I know, I lost many friends because of this.  I ignored this game in 1998, and my level of coolness went right down the tubes.  I had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates again. Children shouldn't play this game.  If you think it's ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person.  Yes that's right: you can walk through a police station in this game.  If in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on (and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again) you now have a place to take out your frustrations- Resident Evil 2. The weapons in this game are realistically cool.  I like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces.  Don't try this at home, but do try this on your Playstation.  The magnum doesn't make much noise so you wouldn't think it'd be such a bad-ass weapon, but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens.  You know you shouldn't do that in real life though, right?  You'd go to jail for a very long time.  And if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies, you'd only get laughed at by the entire court room.  Use your head. If this game doesn't satisfy your sick animal-like needs, then try looking for the fire blaster thing.  You can cook zombies with this.  It's near the end of the game hidden in a locker.  Go near the locker and press the X button, and it will open and you will say \"sweet\". In this game you have two CD's.  One CD is for the Leon adventure, and the other CD is for the Claire adventure.  You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire.  To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire.  I've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast.  I'm sure on normal it's quite harder, maybe so hard you can't think straight and become dumb.  Of course you aren't dumb, it's just that video games can confuse you sometimes. Man I'm tired.  But I'm never too tired to take a couple hours from my easy-going day and blasting my way through this super cool game.  The only downside is that you can't skip the cutscenes.  That's fine at first, when you want to listen closely to the story (even though I didn't) but after a while you really wish Capcom would have put a skip button on this thing. Still, great game.  It's old, but please don't be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old it's not good.  I've been around people who think like that and they just ain't cool.  Sure, these people get all the girls and all the friends, but what else?  What's \"in\" sucks, and what's old is cool.  You think I'm wrong?  Good for you.

But as it turned out the 4 qt is more than enough for one or two people or even if you have a small child.  It's well and simply made and very cheap compared to others out there.  Was not sure about the crude rocking cap but it works, is reliable and simple to  see if the pressure is correct by it's gentle rocking. One decision to buy this was the gasket and other rubber seals are cheap to replace.  The other one I looked at and really liked, the gasket and rubber replacements would cost me nearly $18 dollars a year to upkeep paying for another of their Pressure Cookers in only 3 YEARS!! The aluminum used is soft and scratches and stains easily and is not hardened i.e anodized.  I wish it was but the cost would go higher too.  But the manual gives a way to remove stains.  Have not tried it as the light stains don't bother me.  I also did NOT detect any aluminum taste with dishes that contain acidic ingredients.  A well-known site tested for aluminum and said it leeches .0025 of aluminum, but said when you take an antacid, one tablet contains 250 mg of aluminum!  Drinking from soda cans can give you 1 or 2 mg of it. If that still bothers you go get a stainless-steel one.  But the shape changes compared to the aluminum one even though they have the same capacity.  I think the SS model is flatter and not as tall. I bought it mostly to cook beans in it and it excels at that.  I tried their bean recipe and it's good as any.  Completely satisfied.  I also use it to cook soups, stews and am still experimenting.  I don't know which is better at the moment for doing the latter as I only had this for a few months.  Whether traditional cooking, i.e. Crockpot (failed at beans unless you buy it canned) or traditional stove, coil or gas. I can't seem to get the full flavor nuances on the latter when using the Pressure Cooker, however, strangely, we did gobble up everything made by it.  Cabbage in soup gets overcooked, though, as this is powerful and and has only one setting at 15 lbs.  Perhaps delicate herbs and flavoring get smothered by the extreme pressure?  Maybe not either, as I'm still experimenting in amounts and may take me a year or more to determine the truth, as I don't use fresh herbs and tend to customize my recipes on the fly.

It is a text for any adult in life too.  If you consider it 'Sam I Am' was the ultimate salesperson fo  all time.  I have handed this book to new sales trainees wanting to know  'how to sell' as it gets across the simple example of 'persistence pays  off'.  It sheds light in the manner that salespeople are really the people  whose task it is to introduce new things into the society, and it is upon  their efforts and results that measure the new technology or products  ultimate success.  No new technology goes anywhere without someone along  the line selling it to someone.  I have long since felt that this simple  tale by Dr. Suess conveyed that lesson with this story about 'Sam I  Am'. Additionally this book carries with it a message about really  looking and observing for yourself, and not just allowing your observations  about life to be confined into a snap answer to everything along the lines  of 'It's new or different, I don't like it and won't condsider it.'  Or  'It's not socially acceptable, I couldn't possibly...'  The resistent man  in this tale finally is made to really see things for himself, and  disregard his previous fixed opinions about things.  Ultimately he is  enlightened upon the glories of Sam's offering of Green Eggs and Ham, and  he finds upon actually trying them that he likes them.  This is a timeless  story that holds an incredible message about observation and on the flip  side, persistence. Look at it this way: had Sam not persisted with his  sales efforts, the man would have been denied the happiness he ultimately  found in trying Green Eggs and Ham.  Also if the man never looked and  finally tried it for himself, he would have missed out on some happiness he  did not know existed, because he was forbidding himself to actually look  and experience it himself and knocking aside all social considerations that  would retrain him. I consider this to be more than just a story spun by  Dr. Suess for entertainment of children, but more exactly a lesson about  life to be understood at all levels of society.

Unfortunately, the book comes with maps printed so small it's hard to read them even after you've seen the things they portray in person. And the guide has only a tiny amount of history and background on things... mostly it provides inane comments like \"to the left of XYZ, you'll see ABC\" which a guide like the Eyewitness Guide does more clearly with pictures. (Not to mention its descriptions say things like \"from the entrance you can see...\" without acknowledging that there are 6 separate entrances to the site or clarifying which one it's referring to.) It also provides distinctly un-insightful history saying things like \"[name] was the person who gave real meaning to the abbreviation S.P.Q.R\" but without actually telling you what SPQR stands for or how the person gave it meaning. Perhaps the book is a decent refresher for people who already know Rome's history, but don't expect any insight into things you don't already know.

Garrard","Unlike any of his other books, Dr. Suess's \"The Butter Battle Book\" is as close to an anti-war book as any children's text could be.  It tells of two warring countries divided by a great wall.  The similarity between the East and the West of pre-fall of the Berlin Wall is evident to the plot. The Zooks on one side of the wall eat their bread with the butter side down; the Yooks on the side eat their bread with the butter side up.  This is the reason for the conflict.  Each side feels that theirs is the correct manner for eating bread.  Becoming suspicious of each other, they construct this wall and devise military means to defend themselves from any attack from the other side.  Humorously, the author portrays military strategists as obsessive little men that endlessly work in backrooms creating greater weapons of destruction. The story ends with the two opposing generals facing each other with the ultimate bomb that will destroy the enemy's land.  The grandson of one general asks the question, \"Who's going to drop it?\"  The reply is, \"Be patient...we will see.\" A powerful statement is this for it raises questions about our own relationship in the World Order.

The Republican Spanish government, supported by Russian communists, socialists, American mercenaries, and other foreigners including Hemingway, was fighting nationalist rebels led by General Francisco Franco, who was backed by German Nazis and Italian fascists.  Stalin saw the war as an opportunity to gain another foothold for Russian communism in western Europe and to divert world attention away from the purges occurring in his own country.  Hitler and Mussolini wanted a Chance to test their new war machine.  Hemingway, although not a communist, believed in the Spanish Republican cause.  The war became a dress rehearsal for World War  II.  .  The story is about a band of Republican guerrillas operating behind fascist lines. Their mission  is to blow up a bridge to slow the fascist advance.  Over the course of a few days the members of the group developed friendships, love relationships,and suspicions of each other.  They accomplish their mission , but at a high price.  The main character is wounded, and at his own request is left behind to try to slow the progress  of the enemy so the others can escape.  This is where the story ends.  I was hoping for a more final ending, but over all I was happy with the book.  I had heard of the Spanish Civil War, but like most people I  knew little of the details of the event.  By reading this story I gained much insight into the causes and effects of the war as well as some understanding of Hemingway's attitude toward communism, socialism, and fascism.

Nelson","THE OPERATOR What makes a good book?  A good story, a good writer!  What makes a good reader?  There must be, for me, some connection with the subject matter, and there must a real interest in understanding what the author is trying to say.  Of course, that begs the problem of each (writer and reader) being able to discuss the book either with the author or another reader. I liked the book because of the honesty of O'Neill, and I have several qualifications. First, it was interesting because it explains, in detail, what was/is involved in becoming a Navy Seal; second, the story was told (1st Person) through the eyes (memories and judgment) of one individual (a personal narrative). Qualifications: Robert O'Neill went through several real and important transitions that I related to.  One was his relationships with his fellow Seals and, especially, those who were on his various teams.  These relationships were very strong; they were a transition from a  narrow, personal concern for becoming a Seal to creating a family unit on which military combat relies.  When O'Neill began to change, mature past his Seal experiences, he was finding that many of his Seal brothers were becoming envious of his notoriety  and, therefore, a lack of connection which had been some vital was experienced. Another important relationship was with his wife and children.  This was mentioned in very minimal terms which is somewhat understandable because of the lack of time spent with them.  As his story developed, they became more significant, but it left me wondering about his wife's perception and feelings.  I thought that this deserved more attention because of its importance. The last chapter (23) is quite an ending, and yet it is a beginning for O'Neill.  His view of his life and that The Seal Bubble as over is important.  That statement explains his view of the changes he experienced, of transition from one life-stage to another.  Life-stages are often age/maturity related in combination with changes in activity.  It is a growth and adaptive process which can be difficult.  He recognizes that he is in transition and that he believes his Seal experiences and his processing of those experiences has prepared him for a new stage.  This chapter should be a new book.

The good: - This thing moves air. I set it up as an exhaust fan on one side of my 700 sq ft house, and open a window on the other. Instantly doors swing open (or shut) blinds start waving in the wind. I suppose one couldn't expect more air movement for it's size and cost. - The \"storm guard\" feature is really nice. I like being able to leave it installed and still shut the window when needed. - As it is \"mounted\" in a window, the fan really needs to be reversible, and this one is. The bad: - After a few months it developed a terribly obnoxious rattle. At first I assume a loose screw/washer that I could tighten down. I disassembled the fan and simply can't find the culprit so I now suspect a bad bearing someplace. When it is in it's \"rattle mood\" it rattles regardless of speed or direction. It rattles maybe 25% the time. When not rattling it is quiet enough on low speed to sleep near, but when rattling, I can't stand to be in the same room.

Well, prepare to be delighted. The book contains all the things in the headline of this review and is absolutely not an action adventure story. It is a \"true\" story about the nature of war and how people affect it and are affected by it. What Mr Hemingway taught me is that he is a writer foremost and everything else after. He reminds us that he has been in actual war and that it affects very normal everyday people in generally awful ways. For them (us) there is no happy ending.

Aaron Bellamy","I haven't read much Hemingway, just 'Old man and the Sea' way back in middle school and The Sun Also Rises way back in my twenties. And a handful of stories. The Sun Also Rises really moved me. I once asked a girl in a bar what her favorite last line of any novel was, and she said \"Isn't it pretty to think so\" which is exactly what I was thinking, so I about fell out of my chair. This book is very unusual. I can't say I enjoyed it all that much, but I certainly am thinking about it. Written as if it has been translated directly from Spanish to English, with expletives bleeped out via the word unprintable or obscenity, and conversations that go on and on and on about nothing (kind of like they do in real life). And all of it leads up to something we all know is going to happen... the bell's gonna toll, and it's gonna toll for thee. And when it does, the horror of war and the stupidity of human kind and the ridiculous game of life kind of rears up and slaps you in the face. There are some moments in here too, that just hurt to read, painful to read. Robert Jordan talking of his father's suicide and his lack of respect for his father. As a father myself, and of course knowing Hemingway's life struggles, this just burned to read. And old Anselmo, honorable Anselmo who will kill if he must, but will never enjoy it, never want it, his poor life. A part of me knows - even if it isn't true - that all these people in this book were real. Maybe amalgamations, maybe direct to page, and even if not, it doesn't matter, they are all real. And Pablo drinks wine, bowl after bowl, and it seems like the only answer. And maybe it was. So why do people still talk about Hemingway... why is that word \"hemingway\" one that everyone knows... I think this book must be a big part of it. I haven't hit wikipedia yet, I don't want my thoughts tainted, but this novel strikes me as ahead of its time even now somehow. And like I said, I didn't really enjoy it. And honestly, this is my second stab at it. Got halfway through about ten years ago. But I get it. I get what the big deal is. And it is a big deal.

It also has a release valve at the handle that drops so that you know it is safe to remove the weight on top. I did actually can some pints of salsa with it.

I love the fact that it's backwards portable. You can still insert regular Game Boy cartridges in it, like Tetris, Super Mario Land, or Pokemon Red. Game Boy is a very stable system. It rarely disfunctions. One problem is that when you turn on the Game Boy sometimes the Nintendo sign is messed up. Blowing into the game cartridge doesn't help. You need to re-insert the game cartridge, realligning it correctly. You could blow though, for good luck. Game Boy Color's portability alone is a great plus. It fits in your pocket!

Other than that, this console has improved on its graphics! On games like Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Pokemon Gold and Silver, the graphics are much better! Also, there is a ample amount of color that your eyes can feast on. Now if you have game boy Pocket and Regular game boy and you're playing Pokemon [It doesn't matter which one], you will notice that when you walk around in Pocket, It's very blurry. Well this fault has ben fixed in GameBoy Color. It's extremely helpful because it enables you to see more detail and little things that you couldn't see before. I also have some regular gameboy games that aren't for game boy color and if you play them on GameBoy color, they show little color, but no blurryness. Now make sure you read what the box says when you are buying a gameboy color game. There are two types, there is one that says FOR GAMEBOY COLOR ONLY, which you can't use on the other gameboys. The second type just says that it's for gameboy color. Those you can play on the regular gameboys. It won't show any color but at least you can play it. There are a couple faults for the gameboy color. One of which is that the console is too small [for me I have big fingers so it's hard for a grown up kid]. A second fault is that the batterys run out faster than the Original GameBoy [The gameboy pocket battery use is outrageous! I played the gameboy pocket for 2 hours straight and the batterys were already starting to run out.]. The original gameboy lasted me up to 23 hours! This only lastes me for about 12.

Tucker","Alpha 3 is the culmination of everything Capcom had worked towards with their fighting games. Everyone knows Capcom has the habit of sticking to similar concepts for several games in a row (Mega Man, Resident Evil, etc), but in no other case has the last game in a series before a major change been so fulfilling. Street Fighter Alpha 3 is (in my opinion) the best Street Fighter game available (including the recently-released SF2 HD Remix). The gameplay is a blend of the slow-paced and strategic Street Fighter 2 and the more varied and frenetic Alpha series. Air combos, alpha counters, and flashy finishing moves combine with superior character balancing and deep fighting strategy. The main \"arcade\" experience can be brutally hard, as it would be in the wishes of any Street Fighter fan. The two-player experience is also extremely fun, as players new to the Alpha series can choose different fighting modes, one of which (X-ism) is more aligned with classic SF2 balancing. Other modes include A-ism, the Alpha standard, and V-ism, a mode that enhances a player's ability to chain standard and special moves together for lethal damage. Alpha 3 introduced an incredible World Tour mode, enabling players to tour the world (if you will) fighting various characters under various conditions. These tasks may be as simple as defeating an opponent to as complex as defeating three opponents with only super combo moves whilst your character is low on health. Completing these objectives unlock abilities that can be linked to your character, such as automatic blocking, taking zero damage while blocking, infinite guard, and more. On top of that, characters built up during World Tour mode are playable in other many of the other modes. The other gameplay modes include training, boss battle, survival, and more. Two-player battles can also accommodate multiple player characters, in both versus and cooperative (ie P1 and P2 vs C1 and C2, or P1 and P1 vs P2 and P2). Two-player back in the days of SSF2:Turbo was the only way to play, but Alpha 3 dramatically increased the available options for single players. These lend towards the game's long life, as one player can play in various modes ranging from standard arcade style to fighting bosses to survival mode and more. In essence, Street Fighter Alpha 3 defines fighting games of the Playstation era. It is a smooth balance of speed and strategy. Though the graphics are dated by today's standards, two-dimensional games tend to age gracefully, and this game is no exception. Street Fighter fans owe it to themselves to own a copy of Alpha 3, if not to check a popular franchise's history, then to own the best Street Fighter game ever made.The Ultimate Street Fighter game",3,12],[80000832,4.0,true,"A24KR6ZT4DNKU1","B00002N602","Charles Shields","Does a good job of cooking meats fast.

He is still able to show that there is always some good even in some of the darkest situations.

Myst is one of them. I remember playing this game back in 1993 and getting my but whipped with the puzzles. I recently replayed it and found myself in awe of how well constructed it is. Of course, graphics have advanced since 1993, but Myst shows game developers how puzzles should really work. Unlike too many games today, Myst brilliantly evokes a sense of wonder and mystery. When you start the game, you're just thrown into a new world with no explanation. You are left to explore and discover. There is a story with shocking twists, but the story depends upon your involvement and choices, not simply handed to you. The puzzles require a lot of time and thought. If you don't like puzzles and thinking, don't play this game. If you like challenges, Myst will challenge you. The puzzles often require you to make connections between separate pieces of information or view your environment in a new way. Some are frustrating and I did need to look at a hint guide a few times (particularly for the Mechanical Age elevator) but they all do have a logic. Unlike other reviewers, I found the one area Myst doesn't hold up well is in building an immersive environment. Myst as a world doesn't have a logic. There's a spaceship, a boat, a clock tower, etc., just sitting on the island. It seems more like a video game hub than an actual world. I think Myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the world. Overall, Myst was a historic computer game back in 1993 and is still worth playing 20 years later. From the early 1990s, I personally preferred Presto Studios' Journeyman Project, which also had a compelling point-and-click adventure and featured pre-rendered 3D environments.

To be honest, I chose this one because I was familiar with the Metallica song that was named after this book. I found this to be one of the most difficult books I have ever read; not because of the style or because I didn't like it but because simply it was just a difficult story to read. The novel is full of strong themes about death and honor. Robert Jordan, the main character, is a man who does not get caught up in any causes or seems to hold any passionate views. Through the whole book he questions his beliefs in the socialist cause; his only concern seems to be defeating the fascists. All of this changes when he meets Maria. The two fall for each other immediately and suddenly Jordan is confronted with the real prospect of the fact that he will not survive his mission. What made this story so difficult to read was that Hemmingway comes across as a nihilist in the writing of this story. His characters are completely controlled by fate and feel powerless to stop the events that are put into place. It seems as if Jordan would have been better off had he not met Maria and cared about her. Overall, the story is very good.

However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of \"thy\" and \"thou\" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, \"How do you call yourself?\" instead of \"What is your name?\" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is \"How do you call yourself\" better than \"What is your name\"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these \"translations\" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.

And yet in the end, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is ultimately a novel with a fatalistic outlook and few, if any, redeeming messages for humanity, in spite of all the commentaries it makes about human nature. To me, the story was the most interesting as a reflection of Hemingway's own experiences and strange outlooks on life. For example, one would assume that Robert Jordan, the main character, is a reflection of what Hemingway deems heroic. Like Hemingway, Jordan is a rugged, somewhat independent sort. Jordan characterizes the literary period's allure for the expatriate life and Hemingway's fascination with Spain and dislike for the Spanish Fascist. But yet, one has to wonder what compels Jordan, an American college professor from Montana, to be involved in this Spanish Civil War to the extent that he has become a demolitions expert and is ready to kill Spaniards (regardless of what side they happen to have fallen upon) without any conscience. What busness, really and truly, is this war of his? Further, how do you root for a hero, who is fighting for, and willing to give his life while following orders from, Communists that Hemingway makes clear are every bit as brutal as the Fascists? Notable is the fact that the Jordan character feels shame for a father who committed suicide, just as Hemingway's own father did. And for Hemingway to commit suicide 20 years after this book was written parallels the sense of inevitable doom that is a pervasive theme of this story. This book demonstrates that Hemingway had a way with descriptions and dialogue that can be at times entertaining and at other times irritating. For example, his conventions for speech that is a more literal reflection of the Spanish language is rather clever. However, as the story progresses, Hemingway's usage of the King James-style \"Thee\" and \"Thou\" to indicate that a more formal Spanish dialect is being used becomes distractingly gimmicky and wore quite thin by the end of the book. At least, it did for me. This is a story about people who are flawed to the extent that they will kill without hesitation...people who have abandoned God and Godly virtues, and look to themselves for their own salvation. What little is left is a cause whose means and ends don't seem to differ from the alternative, and an appeal to virtues of loyalty to the band, or one's responsibility to follow his duty. The trouble is, these appeals are made among characters who Jordan - as Hemingway's voice - often considers untrustworthy, repugnant and treacherous. Rather contradictory, I would say. And Jordan's fatalistic sense of duty to a cause of questionable politics and in a country that isn't even his own is just plain strange to say the least. Interesting as character study, and a microcosm of the Spanish Civil War, but very depressing.Descriptive but depressing",1,7],[80000873,4.0,false,"AGEIT17HENDIS","0002051850","Alfred Johnson","I have been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since I was a teenager.  What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish Fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th Brigade, into the struggle. Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class uprisings after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted in one of his writings on Spain that the Spanish proletariat at the start of its revolutionary period had a higher political consciousness than the Russian proletariat in 1917. That analysis calls into question the strategies put forth by the parties of the Popular Front, including the Spanish Communist Party- defeat Franco first, and then make the social transformation of society. Ernest Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bells Toll weighs in on that question. Whatever value the novel had or has as a narrative of a small slice of the Spanish events one must look elsewhere to discovery the causes of the Republican defeat. Ernest Hemingway most definitively was in love with Spain and always lurking just below the surface was his love affair with death. That combination placed in the context of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 makes for an explosive, dramatic tale. The hero is an American, Robert Jordan, aka Ernest Hemingway, of fizzy politics but a desire to help the Spanish people. Additionally Jordan, if expediency demands it, is willing to face danger and death at the command of the Communist-dominated International Brigades (although it is not always clear whether he is a Lincoln Brigade volunteer or a freelancer). Hemingway's critique of the Stalinist domination of the military command and therefore authors of the military strategy that led to defeat at times overwhelms the story. His skewering of Andre Marty, leader of the International Brigades, also has that same effect. In short, Hemingway believed that 'outside forces' meddling in Spanish affairs led to death for Jordan and disaster for the Spanish people. Well, nobody expects nor is it mandatory for a novelist to be politically astute or correct. Here Hemingway joins the crowd The one subject that Ernest Hemingway seemed consistently to excel at was the telling of war stories. And whatever else might be true of For Whom the Bell Tolls it is preeminently a war story. A classic war romance if you have also seen the movie treatment of the book starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. It might be a male thing, it might be a Hemingway thing, or it might be that the nature of war lends itself to dramatic tension that holds a story together. Today, in some literary circles, it is not considered politically correct to laud works by such dead, white males as Hemingway but the flat out truth is that the man could write. If his work stands outside the current canon of American literary efforts then something is wrong with the new canon. To make matters worst the current leftist-oriented literary establishment, grizzled, hard-bitten battle-tested warriors that they are, has not been the only force that has taken aim at Hemingway's head. At the time of publication in 1940 the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, those who actually fought in Spain and the various Communist Parties throughout the world were unhappy with the novel. Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (financially sponsoring volunteers and ambulances, as well as reportage). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings-yes.

Like all great literary works, it transcends the era in which it was written and speaks to readers for generations after the author has passed away.  This is a great novel by a great writer, and I can't understand how anyone would rate this less than five stars.  The novel spans only a few days, and contains the story of Robert Jordan, a volunteer in Spain who is sent on mission to blow up a key bridge with a band of guerillas behind the Nationalist lines as part of a Republican offensive.  The novel is primarily a dialogue between Jordan and the members of the guerilla band.  The tension builds to the final confrontation at the bridge.  There are several extensive sidebars not directly relevant to the main plot, including the discussion of the fate of Pilar's village, and the last stand of El Sordo's guerilla band.  These are probably the best written, most detailed, sections of the novel.  Some would say that these distract from the main story, but I argue that they add richness and depth to the characters and to the events of the main plot. EH writes with a direct, readable prose.  His characters are complex and multi-dimensional, and often conflicted.  One may argue as to whether this is his best work or not, or whether he was a better writer of short stories or novels.  What does it matter?  This is one of the greatest war novels, indeed one of the greatest novels, ever written.  In terms of richness and depth, only Zola's La Debacle is comparable to this work. One thing in particular struck me about this story that make it an unconventional war novel.  Most war novels either take the philosophic position of patriotic glory for the homeland or war as a pointless exercise in destruction.  Robert Jordan has a unique perspective in this book in that he is an outsider fighting for a cause, not for a country or a government.  He isn't driven by patriotism, or love of country.  He isn't fighting for the national army of his homeland.  This gives him a unique perspective to question why he is fighting and what he is fighting for, particularly after he falls in love.Love, duty, courage, and sacrifice",2,4],[80000875,5.0,false,"A2IOKA7AQYLLZU","B00000JL6V","A.

Not to mention that I loved Super Mario 64, but, since I didn't own an N64, I was forced to play it only when I visited my cousin's.

Set during the fascist take over in 1930s Spain, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel that will easily stand the test of time (not much of a prediction since it was written in 1940) and is one of the finest books in the English language.  Jordan, an American, is the main character who comes to Europe to fight the good fight against Franco's military thugs.  The reader is given a fascinating in-depth look into his psyche, where he reflects on his fellow soldiers, plans for warmaking and the justifications and rationalizations along the war trail. Pablo's another character who is burned into your consciousness long after you've finished reading.  A fellow rebel (they weren't rebels in the true sense, since they were fighting for a government they had duly elected; however, they have all the characteristics of guerrillas in that the Spanish military waged an immediate and violent war against that very democratically elected government), the reader is left wondering just how committed he is to the cause.  There is an incredible flashback story detailing Pablo's orchestration of the sadistic torture and humiliation of a group of wealthy fascist sympathizers.  The vivid description involved in this passage is nothing short of extraordinary. Of course the true democrats, fighting for the Republic against the well financed and better armed fascist military, eventually lose the war, but having that foreknowledge does nothing to detract from the cliff-hanger like feelings brought about by the various battles and journeys the rebel crew embarks on. This is the best, and most accessible of all of Hemingway's works.  If someone is interested in reading Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls is the perfect starting point.  As for Hemingway's style of prose, what more can be said, except that it's brilliant, enthralling and readily accessible to the common reader, unlike Joyce and Faulkner.  In my opinion, every American should give some time to Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Commitment, intelligence, sacrifice and fighting for the well being of your fellow man is all there along with a terrific love story. Given that the average American attention span is like a ferret on a double espresso (Dennis Miller), very few will give books like For Whom the Bell Tolls a try with the mass of pop TV garbage out there. An excellent companion to the book is the documentary film \"The Good Fight\" narrated by Studs Terkel.

Hemingway was very good; sycophants made him sublime. To criticize this work and not rhapsodize over its poetic beauty and its insightful symbolism would seem to be almost in bad taste. But I will do so anyway. Overall I would have to say that the story is good but not great: Robert Jordan is an American fighting for the communists in the Spanish civil war. He is an instructor in Spanish at a Montana college who has taken a sabbatical  to secretly come to Spain. He wants to fight to liberate the workingman. Jordan is sent by his Russian controller to join  a band of guerrillas behind Fascist lines. His mission is to blow up a bridge; this is timed to precisely coincide with a Republican (communist) offensive. Anselmo, an old man who is the most reliable guerilla, takes him to the band of rebels. The band is led by Pablo, an uncouth peasant who has gone from fervent murderous radical to a man who only wants to survive. Pilar, Pablo's woman, is the unifying force in Pablo's band. There are assorted other rebels and Maria, a refugee who has been raped by the fascists. Maria and Robert Jordan fall in love immediately and are soon fornicating like rabbits. The bridge is attacked and destroyed but this leads to the death of Anselmo and to Robert Jordan being mortally wounded. He orders Maria to go on without him and he bids her to escape and enjoy life; thereby he will live through her. The book does give a good picture of the issues of the Spanish civil war. The fascists are portrayed as decent people backed by Nazis and Italian fascists. The Republicans are controlled by Russians, as are puppets on a string. Hemingway makes a point to say that the top Republicans all speak Russian, having been trained as revolutionaries in the Soviet Union. The individual peasants Jordan fights with  are mostly portrayed as decent people with a few savages thrown in for good measure. I had several problems with the book. I understand that Hemingway uses the archaic thee and thou to indicate that the dialogue is being spoken in Spanish. He omits this when Jordan is speaking in English or thinking to himself. This takes some getting used to but is tolerable. It is the awkward translation of Spanish obscene phrases that is done in a silly and annoying way. The phrase \"I obscenity in the milk of your father\" appears dozens of times.  No one speaks this way. It is patently unnatural and just about ruined the book for me. I understand that this is a literal translation of the Spanish oath \"me cago en la leche...\" I understand and don't care. It would have been better to leave the obscenity implied but unsaid without resorting to this awkward device. There is a painfully awkward page where Robert Jordan discovers that Pablo has stolen his detonators. On page 368 he says  \"Oh muck my grandfather and muck this whole treacherous mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever\" and so forth ( in lieu of the word that is an acronym for \"for unlawful carnal knowledge\") about two dozen times. I understand that in 1940 that word could not appear in print but did it have to be replaced by something so witless. Funny how that word still can't appear in Amazon.com book reviews in 2002. There is another especially awkward scene that sticks in my mind. Hemingway describes Robert Jordan's feelings at having reached orgasm with Maria on page 379: \"Oh now, now, now, the only now, and above all now  and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. \" and so on for half a page. Give me a break! There is also the problem of some of the poorly drawn and unbelievable characters. Robert Jordan is too perfect to be true (is he Jesus in disguise?). He goes from a mild mannered rural college instructor to a stone killer and demolitions expert in a matter of months. He doesn't have any personal stake in the Spanish conflict but quickly becomes a cool yet eager killer in the service of the Soviet side. His inner dialogue tells us that this is because he has always wanted to do something for downtrodden workers of the world. It is also in part to prove that he is as much a man as his (U.S.) Civil war hero grandfather. The relationship with Maria is unbelievable to the point of being absurd. Jordan is a thirty-something who has never been in love. He and Maria, who is 19,  fall in love at first sight. They immediately decide to have sex ; they plan to get married and live together happily ever after. He is fully aware that he has been handed a suicide mission and is completely unconcerned. How did he live for this long if his own safety is of no interest to him? Much has been made of the fact that this book illustrated the concepts in the Donne poem No Man is an Iland.

The American also falls in love with a young Spanish girl, thus allowing Hemingway to explore his favorite combination of themes, love and war. Hemingway is, in my view, one of the most moving and profound writers of all time.  In this novel, he aptly captures the emotions and motives of those who risk their lives at war, and along the way, offers some extraordinarily memorable stories of both bravery and brutality. To me, the novel's main weakness is the love story.  The protagonist's love interest, as in all of Hemingway's novels, is young (19 years old, in this case), beautiful, naive, and ignorant.  She worships Robert Jordan, and obeys his every command much as a puppy.  Having no mind of her own, she is wholly contented by serving Jordan in ways such as washing his socks and and drying out his sleeping bag. The only other oddity in the novel is Hemingway's habit of translating Spanish literally.  For example, he uses thou and you to differentiate between the Spanish speaker's use of \"tu\" and \"Usted.\"  He also uses such nonsensical phrases as \"I have much hunger\" as a translation for the Spanish \"tengo mucho hambre,\" and \"What passes with thee?\" for \"Qu te pasa?\".

This is a succesfull mix that results in a lot of fun. For most of the game you play as Tarzan, as a adult and as a kid, Terk in the camp level, and the amusing Jane sequence.  The graphics are very good, capturing the spirit of a jungle, with lots of creatures wondering around, light from treetops and lots more.  Disney has always been good in delivering great music that is enjoyable all by itself and Tarzan is no diffrent, with bongos, drums and the themes from the movie. The 3 challenge levels give you a taste of difficulty and a different ending for each one.  The levels are also very cool and neat to play through. Unfortunity Tarzan suffers from some serious problems.  I pretty much gaurantee that you will get very annoyed by the jungle creatures that will try to kill you on your quest for manhood and survival, especially the stupid birds that bombard you with coconuts, and yet, you can never kill them!  What's up with that?! The monkeys are also very annoying  Also, some of the moves can be difficult for young kids to pull off.  The final two levels are really difficult to defeat, and defeating the evil Clayton is really difficult. Overall, Tarzan is a good game that no one should pass up, especially if they want sidescrolling action. The good: Great graphics, nice jungle themes, great music. The bad: Creatures can get VERY annoying And the ugly: Can be really difficult at timesTarzan like game!",6,9],[80000901,5.0,true,"A2I44LL1RPOEN5","B00002N602","diegoc","A gift for my daughter.

When it was released in '97 the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games. The storyline itself was gripping and although it had it's dull moments, it culminated in a spectacular finish.

I own FFIV,V,VI,VII,VIII,IX, and X and have beaten FFVII,VIII,IX,and X and this one is the best. I have to recommend it to everyone, RPG fan or not. Squaresoft was at it's prime in this period what with FFVII & Xenogears, my favorite Squaresoft games. The battle format is the tried and true Active form (you have a \"Active Time Battle\" gauge that fills and when it fills, the character can attack. Enemies don't have to wait for you to use your turn to use theirs). There are tons of commands (Ex. Attack, Deathblow, Magic, Item, Morph, Steal, Mime, etc.) but many require Materia to use. Materia is what you insert into your weapon and armors empty Materia slots to gain the Materias ability while it is equipped. You gain AP as well as EXP and Gil ($) after winning a fight. AP levels up your equipped Materia. It is important not to overload your character with Materia though, because as Cloud says in a tutorial, \"It acts as a double-sided sword. While it gives you abilities, it also can subtract from your stats.\" The story starts small as a rebel group AVALANCHE fighting the Shinra Corporation that is turning the only huge city on Gaia, Midgar, into one big industrial market. They are putting up Mako Reactors that suck the energy from the Earth and convert it to power. AVALANCHE destroys a couple of these in missions and Shinra devises a plan. 18 year old Cloud is just joining AVALANCHE, but reluctantly; he is very cruel hearted and troubled do to his past in the beginning, but that changes. Quickly the scheme becomes much more grandiose as Sephiroth gets involved. AVALANCHE falls apart and the core members and a few other characters leave to follow Sephiroth, while Shinra searches for \"the Promised Land,\" a land with tons of Mako energy. The story is serious. A main character even dies at the climax of the first disc. It leads you through tons of places and aquaints you with many people. Of course the ever popular Biggs and Wedge return, as does Cid (you may not get this if you aren't big for Final Fantasy games). The Limit Breaks are cool. During battle there is a gauge called Limit Break which fills when you are attacked. When it fills all the way, you can use Limit Breaks which are very strong attacks. You learn new ones by using previous ones or a variety of other ways for certain characters. The status effects such as Poison or Mute are used. The ammount of Materia is staggering. The summons are great, but one stands out as fairly impossible to not be a one hit kill, besides on Safer Sephiroth if he has on Wall, or Emerald and Ruby Weapon regardless. This summon is common knowledge for Final Fantasy enthusiasts, Knights of the Round, where 13 knights attack the enemies. If you have a good magic stat, they do a good 9000 damage per attack (9000 x 13 = 117,000 damage). The graphics are standout awesome for their time, but nowadays they aren't special and the character designs are a disaster, but again, they were awesome back in the days. The sound is top notch with awesome music. Just like Xenogears, it's one of those few games where I like the music. There are a few huge [disappointments] (the chocobo battle music) and a few instant favorites (the Safer Sephiroth music, \"One Winged Angel\"). The game length is about 40-50 hours, but you'll keep playing it to get to level 99 and complete every last side quest (like me!) and clock in 70 hours if you have one ounce of common sense. The control is flawless except for the X for cancel and Circle for confirm, but that can be fixed with the customizable controls very easily.

This book is actually fiction with the noble aim of improving the person who is reading it like a self-help book. The book itself centers around the story of a former big-shot lawyer. The lawyer had a self-described wake-up call after a heart attack. This rude awakening led him to sell his possessions and to look for a more meaningful life from certain sages in the East. Of course, the rest of the book is him recounting what he learned. This book has a number of practical suggestions to lower stress and help you feel happier. Things like breathing deeply, living in the present moment, serving others, continually improving yourself, making the most of your time, and taking time out for self-reflection. There are many important lessons about what's really important in life. Is having a big bank account more important than peace of mind? Do fancy cars and clothes bring more happiness than spending quality time with your family and friends? I don't think there's any debate of the value of the message. Who couldn't put these admonishments to good use? I think the real challenge is practicing the techniques described. The book itself even advises that people need to stick with these techniques for at least three weeks till they become habit. One thing that knocked the book a little for me was the cliches. For instance, the cliche of emptying your cup is used in this book. I've read this story of the master who keeps pouring tea into the cup till it's overflowing at least one hundred times. There were some other cliches used that I've also heard plenty of times. This made the book at times seem a little on the cheesy side and a bit unoriginal.

What a cliche!  Masterpiece; a term suggesting the undisputed magnum opus of an already venerable company.  Many things gain this mark, but few live up to their expectation.  Final Fantasy 7 does. In many ways, Final Fantasy 7 is far from perfect.  The graphics, compared to today, are dated, grainy, and harsh.  The storyline reeks of cliche-ridden overtones.  The characters seem generic.  However, this is all a product of subsequent games. Final Fantasy 7 defined the 3D graphical engine used in almost all of today's RPGs.  Its characters, still fresh, were very unique, emotionally unstable, and enjoyable to read about.  The storyline spins off numerous tangents and undertones that suggested a fully functioning, realistic world that presents real-life human troubles. This is far from a typical RPG.  From its conception, it redefined the genre and introduced the RPG to about 3 million new gamers.  Saying that Final Fantasy 7 single-handedly elevated RPGs from niche to mainstream status would be far from an erraneous statement. Considering all of these things, a person skeptical about playing Final Fantasy 7 should grant reconsideration.

The plot unfolds throughout the game, picking up its pace toward the end, but not falling prey to the common problem of tying up all the plot threads in two minutes.  It's well-paced, the plot twists arising out of the characters and situations as presented, and nothing really shows up as a deus ex machina (except for the bit with the blasted snake ...) The characters are generally well-developed;  while the three main characters get most of the development, each of the other characters, including the optional ones, get a few scenes with insight into their actions or their pasts.  These characters also have reasons to be working together, rather than just thrown together haphazardly. The female characters are excellent, though Aeris is just a bit TOO perky. The villain is excellent, well-handled and well-developed.  The lesser villains and some of the other NPCs also get a bit of character development (the optional quest in Wutai with the Turks has to be one of my favorite bits in the game), And the villains' actions make sense within the context. The materia system is complicated.  Expect to spend some time fussing with it to understand how it works.  This is not necessarily a negative, mind. The music is great.  From what I understand, it's a distinct departure from the earlier games, but I haven't played them.  There are a few mediocre pieces, such as Honeybee Manor, but the truly excellent pieces, such as the Turks' Theme, Nightmare's Beginning (Vincent's Theme), and One-Winged Angel (final battle music), more than make up for them, and there are no truly annoying God-don't-play-this-song-again pieces in it.

First off, the sound is god awful.  Everything from this game sounds like it's coming from a small FM Radio with nearly dead batteries from the other end of a long tunnel.  It's that bad.  Not to mention that there are a few sound glitches where some of the sound effects don't even play for a few moments.  So, for example, you periodically won't hear Ryu yell, \"Hadoken\" for a short period of time.  But the sound doesn't make the game, the controls do.  And that's my next gripe. Unless you are on an Aracde Stick, you'll have a harder time playing this game then you would on a keyboard.  Not only does this game not support the analog stick, but the control pad isn't very responsive at all.  And no, it's not the controller.  I've played KOF 98 and 99, Street Fighter 3: Double Impact, and Soul Calibur 1 all on the same controller.  And I haven't had nearly as many problems with the controls on those games as I've had here.  Not to mention, you have shoulder buttons for the FP and FK.  In MVC2, you won't mind shoulder buttons because that game has a 4 button layout with FP and FK used almost souly for calling the helpers.  MVC1 still has the 6 button layout as its other Capcom brothers.  Meaning a standard Dreamcast controller isn't very suitable for a fast paced game such as this.  Every nanosecond counts in this game and you can't have sluggish shoulder buttons slowing you down.  Street Fighter 3 and Alpha can get away with it, but not this game.  In short, get a Mad Catz Dreampad or some sort of Aracde Stick if you're going to get this game. Single player also gets rather dull pretty quickly.  This game is meant for competition as far as I'm concerned.  Casual players will enjoy this game, but the computer is either very easy or very hard and there isn't much middle ground. On the plus end, the game itself is completely intact from the CPS2 version.  And it even has the added Onslaught Mode after you unlock all the hidden fighters.  It also has a 4 player tag battle mode as well.  And that is probably the main reason to get this game.  I, myself, play 4 player tag battle with MAME on Kaillera all the time and I have a blast.  But for those of you that don't believe in emulation and have 3 friends around, this is just as good. All in all, this is one of those party games that's good for playing at an Anime/Video Game convention, for instance.  And while most people sing praises about MVC2, MVC1 is a very solid and competitive game.  The characters are quite unbalanced.  But it doesn't seem to hinder the game in the least bit.  Sans the small rooster of characters, this can be considered supieror to MVC2 in certain ways.  Pick it up if you have some friends around.

I've been a computer geek since childhood and have worked at dot.com startups and videogame companies. I've experienced both the highs and the lows of this realm: from the elation of being part of a hit product to the lonely, grinding monotony of twelve-hour days in front of a computer screen in interminable crunch mode. It's clear that Coupland has some personal experience with the demographic he's writing about, the young, brilliant, socially compartmentalized 90's tech worker (AKA geek) trapped in an unfufilling career, trying to invent a better existance. Via the journal of the central character, Dan, he lovingly brings to life the geek mind, with all its ideosyncracies, obsessions, and tangential ponderings, and frames it with an abundance of 90's pop culture references. The characters are fun, quirky, and bear more than a passing resemblance to people I've known in real life. Coupland engineers enough drama, friendship, and events among the close-knit cohorts to keep the reader turning the pages, as well as plenty of thoughtful, apparently off-the-cuff musings about the effects of technology on modern life, and the book is really a breeze to read. I suggested Microserfs to several non-geek friends, and they enjoyed it greatly. The book does have its weaknesses, though. For one, it's obvious that Coupland is an outsider when it comes to computer technology, which gives some of the book's plot points a false ring. The average reader probably won't notice, but the average Wired reader just might. Also, he sometimes tries to invest his characters with a little too much geek cred, which makes them unconvincing at times (or hard to tell apart). Maybe I don't know enough female techies, but Dusty and Amy seemed particularly unlifelike. Still, I give Microserfs a thumbs up. It's an easy, fun read, and captures the overall spirit of a particular subculture (as well as its angst) at an unique moment in history. It would be interesting if Coupland wrote a \"ten years later\" sequel and we could find out where his characters are in their mid-30s, in the present day (their Lego project probably would have been a failure in the real world). If you like this book (or if you are a geek who was disappointed with it), I highly recommend \"Hackers\" by Steven Levy, a spirited account of the real life computer geek world from the 60s through the early 80s.

After about fifty pages, I found the sophomoric metaphysics and self-important view of programming to be more than a bit self-indulgent.  It's totally Gen-X centered, but I guess that figures, given that Coupland introduced the term in another book. Written as a diary, it follows a programmer for Microsoft who uproots with his group house gang and moves to the Bay Area.  You'll get a lot of musing about cars favored in Seattle vs. the Bay Area as well as the Gap.  Costco is prominent, as are legos, the Mac, etc.  The book should be loads of fun.  Even lots of Star Trek references. But it just doesn't ring true, either technically or in terms of the VC-driven world of startups.

As you get older, the bottom line becomes to survive as best you can.\" -\"It's your world now... it's yours.\" Douglas Coupland is popular with my generation, most likely because he makes keen observations about life from a perspective people of the X Generation can understand and relate to. Heck he must be the expert since he coined the term \"Generation X\". However, he also must appeal to the ME ME ME IT'S ALL ABOUT ME self-centredness that is a part of the nature of most people of this generation. Also it must appeal to their short attention spans and complete irreverence toward just about everything. I recognise that this is a generalisation, and I am not condemning Coupland nor his fans. I am simply saying that Coupland's writing style is idiosyncratic and definitely has one target audience. I read his earlier works, and I enjoyed them more or less, but there is a quality to Coupland's writing that seems very surface and artificial despite his astute and timely observations about people and things. Coupland is genuinely witty in his writing, but most of the time I find that he tries too hard. What I mean by this is that he overreaches for authenticity. For example, in Microserfs, he writes about how he went shopping at the Uwajimaya on 156th in Bellevue. Locals will be impressed that he knows his stuff and people from outside of the greater Bellevue/Redmond/Eastside area will be impressed with his knowledge, or maybe his imagination if they don't know that Uwajimaya is really on 156th in Bellevue. The problem for me, though, is that these little things just go too far by a tiny amount that just push these references right over the thin line of what is clever and what is trying too hard. Maybe just Uwajimaya in Bellevue OR Uwajimaya on 156th. Either/or but not both! Just too many offhand refences to places, landmarks (like the now-imploded Kingdome) and local \"things\" to prove he had actually done his homework or something. I know some people were very impressed by that level of detail, but I found it, once again, artificial. Coupland writes Microserfs like a journal and brings up many interesting points, like how Gen X parents expected their company to take care of them forever and in exchange the employees gave unwavering loyalty. Gen Xers think of almost all jobs as temporary stepping stones to something else. Interestingly, most of what technical talk Coupland included is all pretty out of date considering that the software industry moves like lightning. Most of the interesting observations come in the beginning of the book when the main character is still working for Microsoft. Most of Coupland's references are so dead-on with regard to Microsoft culture and life, which is probably why most Microsofties read it and like it. However, when all the employees move to the Bay Area to work at a start-up, the book completely loses direction and all sense of coherence. The narrator, Dan, discusses his co-workers and their quirks, discusses how he does not understand what exactly the \"Information Superhighway\" is supposed to be and goes off on a tangent about how major freeway construction died around 1975. He notes that only foreign employees at Microsoft seem to smoke, and it is not a surprise that user-friendliness is a West Coast American concept. Later in the book, the observations deteriorate to Dan reporting what his friends have said, such as the reasons why breakfast cereals are \"decadent\" or Karla and other characters discussing how their Barbie dolls had sex lives. Yes the book explores the ever-searching nature of people born in this generation, yes the book examines the culture of Microsoft and can be painstakingly funny in doing so, and yes the book is readable.

No. It can be read in a half day for fun, and that should be all you read it for.YES, WELL, YOU GEEKS ARE AN ODD BLEND OF DOORS AND BRAKES.",1,6],[80000997,4.0,false,"AJKWF4W7QD4NS","B00000K10O","N.

On the bus, in the car,  walking down the street, on lunch breaks at work -- I read this book  nonstop until I was finished. It details the lives of several Microsoft  employees who quit the B-B-B-B-BILL culture at Microsoft and move to  Silicon Valley to form a startup tech company.  The opening pages about  Microsoft drew me in, because I work in Redmond WA and a lot of what he  wrote about was very familiar -- and hilarious -- to me. I thought that  the entire book would be that way -- amusing comments about Microsoft  corporate culture -- but after the characters move to the Silicon Valley,  it becomes more introspective, a character study of the lives of these  restless, highly educated, self-named geeks. It's quirky, with lots of  pop culture references, but it's also wonderfully insightful and sweet.  As  I closed the final page, I felt as though I'd had a really moving  experience, and it's not every day that I feel that way after having read a  book.

Unlike other thermos-type cups, this one actually keeps the beverage hot for quite some time, especially if you place the cap on it. The cap itself is really unique in the way it works. After filling with a hot liquid the cap fits rather loosely in place. But, after a few seconds heat expands it and it wedges itself in place very securely. You can still pry it off but not easily when it's hot which is just what you'd want. Also, that cap has a neat little sliding anti-splash tab on the top that actually works. The cup is wide enough to be stable sitting on a flat surface - with or without liquid in it - yet fits easily into a car tray cup holder for travel. After using the cup for a few days I decided that I didn't want the nylon handle. I simply used a heat gun (on low) to gently heat it up and just pulled it down and off of the cup. That handle is secured to the cup with some glue and a slight ridge running around its inner circumference. It was easy to clean off the remaining glue from the stainless steel and I could - if I wanted to - re-glue and reattach the handle.

And I'm happy to say that the game is indeed awesome.  Great cars, great tracks and racing modes, excellent gameplay and graphics.  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen.  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement, which are new to the series. At first, I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT 2 had, where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty, then lose big time on medium.  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from 5 levels of challenge, then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options.  Basically, you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering, or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you.  Love this feature!  Sadly, there is no option to increase the 360 controller's dead zone or adjust the sensitivity.  I'm doing ok as is, but some tweaking would be ideal. Much like the previous two games, the handling is a bit flighty.  But that's speeding on loose ground for you.  Still, I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT 2.  Still no cigar, but it's a step forward.  The game runs as smooth as silk on my 560ti wih all the settings maxed.  No issues whatsoever.

Dirt 1 was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments, including Pike's Peak.  You got to race semi trucks, cargo trucks, trophy trucks, SUVs, and rally cars in Dirt 1.  The advancement was like a pyramid, unlocking levels as you go. I have a Toyota Tundra, so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it.  Dirt 2 made it more radical with nice music and an attitude.  The races were longer and became more X-Games like. I enjoyed the Baja races very much. But, I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated, patched, etc before you can actually play for the first time. Once you get past this, things get better. The choice of vehicles were more limited, but the liveries try to make up for it. Dirt 3 keeps the same attitude and cool music, but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment: sign in, patch , etc. before the first game time.  Once you get past this, it does get better.  At first, I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down.  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting.  I use a gamepad to play on the PC.  I was pleasantly surprised that my 9800 GTX 512 MB plays this game rather well at 1680x1050 (no AA).  The races are largely rally with some interesting winter-time truck races in the snow.  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like.  I also hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live.  Many of the cars are available to purchase too.  That is cheesy and not appreciated.  You don't need to purchase these to advance though.  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging. Being a hoonigan takes practice, patience, and many banged up cars. The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt 3.  I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt 2.  Dirt 3 seems to have a focus on other things, but it is still fun overall. For $12, I got my money's worth.

Dirt 3 for PC is in an even worse boat than most since it's been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX11 compliant ATI video card. As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new. This is a shame because Dirt 3 is a fun little game. There's a great assortment of multinational tracks, and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from. As a rally game, Dirt 3 ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns. Dirt 3 wears a veneer of noisy, fun arcade-style game play, but under the hood it calls for quick reactions, a good understanding of road surfaces, and nerves of steel. Sadly, it also calls for a gamepad or wheel- you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all-or-nothing for serious racing. PROS: -Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX 11 effects -Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive -Successfully models an arcade-like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling -In-car camera gives a stomach-churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and 2-wheel hairpins -Probably the most realistic depiction of drifting/powersliding to appear in a video game (it's frightening, nauseating, and usually a bad idea) -3D support! CONS: -Lower difficulties aren't much fun, highest difficulty is brutally hard -Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers (Dirt 3 players seem pretty nice though) -Essentially requires some sort of analog input -May confuse players who aren't familiar with the rules and conditions of rally-style racing Other thoughts: -You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube.

I'm not sure if he's running out of steam, or if the life stories of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee don't allow much development at this point.  The dense subplotting and evocative details about Navajo life, so evident in the best Leaphorn/Chee stories, are mostly missing here.  Hillerman seems to have been motivated mainly by a desire to wrap up the Jim Chee/Bernie Manuelito relationship, which he does, but not in a particularly original way.  If you are new to this series, try the books written in the 1980's to get a better sense of Hillerman's considerable talent; The Dark Wind is probably the best of the best.OK, but far from Hillerman's best</td><td>2</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>80000025</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>AJ3QKWL8CT3TT</td><td>1605160512</td><td>J.

The early books were traditional police procedurals set in the unique environment and society of the Navajo Reservation.  The crimes that led to murder were relatively small in magnitude: stealing Indian artifacts, robbing a casino, or revenge.  In recent Hillerman books, the crimes have grown in scope to encompass serial killing, international drug smuggling, and theft of billions of dollars worth of natural gas.  Bigger is not necessarily better.  The Sinister Pig seems closer to Ludlum that to early Hillerman. A CIA expert on middle eastern oil pipeline technology is murdered while on a freelance investigation for a US Senator in the Four Corners area.  Both Chee and the local FBI agent are quickly frozen out of the investigation by FBI headquarters.  Chee continues to probe for information with help from the retired Leaphorn, \"Cowboy\" Dashee (now a BLM law enforcement officer), and Bernie Manuelito who has joined the US Customs Border Patrol. As in Wailing Wind, Bernie is the pivotal character in the story.  Through her eyes Hillerman shows the reader how the US Government goes about trying to interdict illegal immigration and drug trafficking on the border with Mexico.  It is not pretty.  Chee is as inept as ever in dealing with his romantic interest in Bernie.  While there were genuine obstacles to overcome in Chee's earlier love affairs, his inability to make his true feelings known to Ms Manuelito seems merely callow. We know who the villain of the piece is almost from the outset.  He not only has the CIA agent killed, but arranges to have a young congrssional aide he has impregnated vanish.  Lacking the whodunit element, the reader has only suspense to fuel his interest. Hillerman's descriptive skill is as sharp as ever and his ear for dialogue as true.  Leaphorn is still Leaphorn.

Here is an authentic tribal setting that is engaging in its freshness and ring of truth; this is a mystery of riveting vigor. Sgt.

From the scandal at the Department of Interior concerning a missing four or forty billion dollars of Indian Trust money to the capitol of the United States, this tale grabs and holds the reader.

It is another superb novel, and nearly on par with his other works. The Sinister Pig offers many characters familiar to  Hillerman's readers. Jim Chee continues to be a main focus, as does his prospective love interest, Bernadette Manuelito, now a novice customs officer working in southern New Mexico. Manuelito stumbles into trouble, drawing Chee and a host of others into the picture. Not the least of these others is the \"legendary\" ex-Captain Joe Leaphorn and his new \"sidekick\" character, Dr. Bourbonet. Several new characters - a Guatemalan exile, a Washington DC attorney and an erstwhile law student -- are particular to this story. Still, they're well-written and compelling, and extend the depth of the story past the usual boundaries of a mystery. As the story develops, the reader will notice a series of evolutionary departures from Hillerman's standard fare. Foremost among these is the fact that story reads less like a mystery than a suspense novel. While it's true that there is a murder, and it is something of a mystery, the good guys and the bad guys all have their identities and roles out on the table pretty early on in the book. From there, the reader gets to anticipate whether the good guys (Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and a few others) will find and capture the bad guys before they succeed in any of their nefarious plans. Since the reader knows how the pieces fit together before the characters, the story really revolves around the suspense, rather than the \"whodunit\" aspect of the plot. At the same time, some other changes seem to be brewing in Hillerman's writing. First, while Hillerman has always shifted points of view frequently in his stories, it seems like no point of view is particularly dominant in this book. From my recollection, that's a little different than in his earlier writing. Chee, Manuelito, Leaphorn and three major characters particular to this book all get some time in front of the point-of-view lens. It doesn't hamper the story, but for those used to watching Chee or Leaphorn solve a mystery, it's a little new. The other key difference is that much of this novel takes place off the Navajo reservation that's so familiar to Hillerman readers. While that doesn't hamper the story either, for me it left the novel with a very different feel. Prior works were well-steeped in Navajo (and sometimes Hopi) cultural flavor, and I enjoyed this aspect of his works. That flavor, for me, got largely crowded out by other story elements in this book. It didn't ruin the work, but I did find that I missed that content, and hope he returns to it in the future. Far from harming the work, these differences and changes simply present the story in a different light. Sinister Pig is an excellent novel, and well lives up to the expectations that Hillerman's readers have. I give it five stars for it's strong story, good characters and compelling tempo. I don't think readers, whether they've read Hillerman before or not, could be disappointed by this  book.Different, But Still Very Good</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>80000071</td><td>1.0</td><td>true</td><td>A2KGTIG05HRSAV</td><td>9629971372</td><td>Coasty</td><td>I was really mad that on the buying site it said it was made buy Sony and found out later it was made in China!

Bates</td><td>For the dedicated Hillerman reader, this latest may be disappointing.  We have become accustomed to excellent mysteries which are also anthropology lessons.  In almost if not every story of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee, Tony Hillerman has presented his readers with lessons about many facets of the southwestern Native American culture, the problems this culture faces.  This novel is more a straight thriller, without significant overtones of cultural stress and adaptation.  The basic plot line does have a Native American connection.  It seems that the Department of the Interior is responsible for a trust fund for Native Americans.  The trust is where royalties and other payments for oil, gas, timber, and other sales from reservation lands are deposited so that the money can be used for the benefit of the tribes.  It also seems that tens of billions of dollars which should be in the trust are not, and there doesn't seem to be any explanation.  A senator hires a retiring CIA specialist in pipelines to investigate what is happening in the \"four-corners\" territory, especially as it related to activities of a billionaire recluse who may be dabbling in hard drugs as well as petroleum.  The implication is that the billionaire is diverting gas and oil from the pipeline and avoiding paying royalties-or anything else.  The covert investigator is found murdered on the reservation and Jim Chee is the investigating officer.  But the FBI claims jurisdiction, transfers case management to Washington, and then stonewalls.  Chee wonders why the apparent cover-up and keeps on digging.  Enough waves are made that DC people involved in investigating the trust fund situation wonder if there is a connection and ask Joe Leaphorn, now retired, to look into the case.  What follows is a very good thriller, with unlikely \"heroes\" and bad guys getting their just desserts.  The implications of Washington insider conspiracies are raised but never resolved; yet, while not quite up to Hillerman's stories which do have stronger cultural lessons, this is a very good book.

I belive I later when I was about 14  got the newer playstation version. I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe 10 to 40 hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe 30 to 80  hours maybe more or less. This game will be fun once you get used to some changes. One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou 4 to 6 six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about  130 to maybe 350 pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made.  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake.  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo. With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily. Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers. As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon. Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed. Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe 45 second  20 minutes maybeless. This  is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic, and Rusha and Beta no longer exist.

After finishing the MMLP, I went straight into the Eminem Show.  Which one is better? I'm still not sure. I think I like my five favorite songs from The Eminem Show better than my five favorite from MMLP, but I think MMLP is better top to bottom.  There are a few songs on The Eminem Show (Drips, Solider, Cleanin' Out My Closet, Saying Goodbye to Hollywood) that are entirely skippable, and you just don't have that on the MMLP. I would highlight the Sing for the Moment track as a standout as I believe it is the first time that Em used a classic rock track as the foundation of a song, an awesome trend he would continue in the future. The beat for Superman is just spectacular, matching Em's disgusted lyrics and delivery perfectly.  While it is a little shy of the MMLP standard, it is still a tremendous cd and well worth the listen if you are an Eminem fan.A worthy follow-up to the incredible Marshall Mathers LP</td><td>7</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>80000119</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A3QZ81L3DIO5C1</td><td>5509356839</td><td>Michael L.

Listened to it in my truck on an hour drive (which wasn't long enough to listen in one sitting). I listen to all kinds of music...opera, rock, country. I don't dislike rap but I don't listen to it very much. Got this from the library and thought I would give it a try. I can understand why he is liked so much. Great beat...could hardly stop bobbing my head. I listened to it while driving...windows down...bass beating. Felt like a gangsta! The lyrics can certainly offend many people but I took it as a history lesson of what young people are up too. I think the guy is a genius. The amazing speed that he can spit out sentences is astounding. Really forces you to focus on what he is saying. Every song on this CD is different but they all have the entrancing beat. The song, \"Cleaning out my Closet\" is really touching and sad. Sure this is all explicit. But banning his music is like burning Beatle records or not allowing Elvis to move his hips on TV. Every generation has somebody that they try to stop from getting messages to the young folk. It is his story and he is telling it his way. I've met people who think they shouldn't cuss on war shows...that they don't need it. It is because of that, that people think war is gallant and heroic (which sometimes it can be). Instead they need to be showing people screaming, cussing when their leg is blown off - that is real. Why would you want to edit it? Eminem is telling his story his way. It is his emotions pouring out in his song. If you don't like it then don't buy it. Don't ban it. This is a really good album. I just listened to it again yesterday whilst walking. I was able to really concentrate on the lyrics. Give it a chance older folks! To me this is every bit as classic \"album\" as Dark Side of the Moon, Days of Future Passed and Take Five.

The battle engine has few innovations, the graphics are standard 2D cutesy sprites on  a rather featureless 3D background, and the plot is riddled with  problems. Sure, in combat you can turn into eleven different kinds of  dragons, but so what!  At no point in the game are you actually required to  do so. In fact, you can go through the game with no need of a sinle  transformation. Experimenting with different dragon genes (necessary to  discover the above-mentioned dragon types) is tedious and wastes your MP.  In fact, transforming into a dragon wastes so much of your magic, that it  sort of invalidates any strategy. The random battles are copious,  considering the fact that for most of the game you fight with no purpose in  mind. Thankfully, most enemies have a trick or two up their sleeve that you  can learn and perform yourself (most of the ones you can learn are  useless). Combat in this game just isn't fun, probably because it has  nothing to do with the plot. The plot is surprisingly bare and devoid of  livelihood. Just as an example, before you meet the final boss at the end  of the game, you will have no idea that she is there. Neither will you know  for sure why exactly you are fighting her. The plot has a lot of  interesting parts that are left unexplained. Some of the human interactions  seem realistic, but all of the realism is drained away by the fifth time  you are beaten up and kidnapped by the same pair of bandits. The  soundtrack features several off-beat tunes, but otherwise is bleak. You'll  spend most of your game-time listening to no more than five tunes. There  are also a few small things that are sure to irritate. Specific characters  are necessary to perform certain tasks (only the walking onion character  can break the glass seal on an emergency door), but switching characters in  your party is a long and tedious task. Sometimes it takes several seconds  to quit certain conversations, and sometimes there is lag between character  actions in combat. I've never played the other installments in the Breath  of Fire series, so I cannot be sure of their quality. However, if they are  on the same level as this tepid piece of software, they desperately lack  appeal.Of dragons and boredom</td><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>80000126</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A3Q6AX1YCO59PF</td><td>0001384198</td><td>mossy</td><td>classic child book everyone should haveFive Stars</td><td>6</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>80000127</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1TWMOZ5J7CFDV</td><td>0001384198</td><td>Wendy</td><td>This classic has always been one of my favorite stories.

This game redefined the role playing wheel, when it was released on PS1. It was a smash hit, and has since spawned many sequels to the original game. The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including: NES, SNES, Sega, etc. The controls are challenging, and to someone who doesn't want to take the time getting used to it impossible. However, when you buy an RPG you want a challenge, and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels. As far as game control goes, it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do. She can do a variety of things like different jumps, flips, crawling, fighting moves, etc. If you have no patience, this game will drive you crazy. It really is a shame that some people tear down this game, when they have no idea what they are talking about. Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge, not me. This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves, fighting moves, jumps, etc. I like that, and if challenge is what you want, this delivers. Once you learn how the controls operate, you realize it is quite easy to use. The graphics are really well done, and definitely an improvement over older platforms, too. The characters, and scenery are much sharper, in higher definition for then previous platforms, and more with more colors. One of my favorite characters is the huge T-Rex you must fight. It looks like a T-Rex, too. The graphics are just awesome. I love how the blood flies, when you kill an animal. Previous platforms didn't really do that, and  in such detail. Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted, but with even more vantage points. You can view yourself from pretty much any angle. Top, bottom, sides, any angle, at any given moment. You can watch yourself from the side, then go to top view, bottom view, etc, etc. It's just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms. The music in this game is very well done, and of CD sound quality. The music is crystal clear, and fits the game perfectly. The background music is often very hauntingly eerie. Also, the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality, too. This game has many, many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile. Lots of different scenery in different places of the world. You find yourself in a variety of places, and not just dungeons, and caves, but there is plenty of that, as well. If getting through the many challenging levels, and trying to stay alive isn't enough for you, there are many, many hidden secrets for you too find, also. Some are easy to find, some are pretty challenging to find. If you love exploring caves, catacombs, dungeons, and having to constantly fight, then you will love this game. Lots of challenges, puzzles, and lots of ways to die, too. The game requires patience, and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have.

Fast paced and fun, easy controls and cool lvl design. One other thing is graphics, moderate maybe for ps1, but just bad by todays standards when some ps1's still hold up better.

Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, \"Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before.\" Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).I need this and the second one</td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>80000158</td><td>3.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1G2ASLL2YWM81</td><td>0001384198</td><td>S.

These are the perfect size for dips, pills, spices, jewelry, safety pins, etc.  The tops fit very tightly, which I like; plus, the materials are high quality and attractive.  This is exactly what I would expect from the Tupperware brand.  I will probably purchase more of these in the future.  I only wish they were easier to find.

Although it's rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart, it makes for a really fun game. You play as one of 6 grade school children, collect items and weapons, knock off enemies with these items and weapons, do tricks, and get money while trying to win the race. Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game, this still is a great game. The game looks pretty nice for N64 standards, the controls are tight, the sounds are good and the music is very catchy. This game also uses great ideas, such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky (but really enjoyable) courses. In fact, some of the courses have no snow on them! But that's the fun of this game: getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain, while at the same time, hitting your opponents with pie-pans, bombs, rocks and other items. It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just can't explain. But it's not all fun and games though. There are some problems. First, is the game's image. Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game, though I liked it so much, I didn't care. The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data. The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires 121 of the 123 pages in the Controller Pak, you'll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also (Mystical Ninja starring Goemon, Rugrats In Paris) or games where you want to save data for safe keeping (Wave Race 64, Perfect Dark). But even with these issues, the game is still really fun and worth playing. If you like it and still want more, try its sequel, Snowboard Kids 2. But try the original first to see if you like the style of play. I'll bet dollars to donuts that you'll enjoy it, though.

A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location, you have to do a real time search to catch the \"bad\" guys towards the end. Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, & The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough. There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good, but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier (like being able to get a password for your own computer.

This game uses a entirely new engine built from the ground up since it was a new developer working with the series. I have personally played this game and will say that its garbage and not even worth being mentioned as apart of TM series. The cars control bad plus the graphics look realistic like the first game rather than cartoonish like the second game. Its basically the same as TM2 where you travel around the world to places like Tokyo, London, Area 51, Egypt, Hollywood, just to name a few levels. A few characters from the previous games are in the game like Darkside, Hammerhead, Sweet Tooth, Thumper, Outlaw, Mr, Grim, Specter, Warthog, Minion, as well as new characters. The endings for the characters are really cheesy unlike TM2 which was pretty dark. The game also allows you to hook up a multi-tap to play with four other friends well three but four if you include yourself.New developer takes over the series</td><td>3</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>80000179</td><td>2.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1ZZLBFM9MCA5F</td><td>0001384198</td><td>Boncuk</td><td>I bought this book because the story is non-sexist unlike all other train stories (a little female engine who helps, for a change, a male character!).

This is the second of this exact model of paper towel holder that I have owned, and I bought this as a replacement for the first one. I had the first one for about eight years, and it finally broke, requiring replacement. The thing I like about this specific towel holder is the design (wall or under cabinet mounting is at your option) which allows the roll to be slipped onto the central retaining spindle without requiring support at both ends, making for a secure towel holder that will not allow the roll of towels to fly out of the holder which is common in some holders which retain the towel roll by pressure on opposite ends of the roll. Another nice feature of this holder is the slightly upturned end of the roll retaining bar to prevent the roll from slipping off the rod when towels are aggressively pulled off the roll, especially with one handed operation. Overall this has been a great paper towel holder. I gave this holder four stars for one reason only, which is that being exclusively plastic it is vulnerable to fatigue cracking of the mounting cylinder, which requires replacement of the unit. This is exactly what finished off my old unit (it cracked at the attachment flange area and was not repairable.) Nonetheless, for a unit of this cost, I am very pleased with the overall performance, appearance, and value of this paper towel holder and would recommend it without reservation.Flexibility in a Paper Towel Holder</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>80000181</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1XXFXNL0TDS5X</td><td>7229004187</td><td>Richardao</td><td>Well made and I use them as Colanders and as bowls to hold produce, fruit etc. A great buy.

It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay.  However, it had two marks against it.  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards.  The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, \"Shadows...\" lacks any real replay value.  The introduction of \"Star Wars: Rogue Squadron\" (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform. \"Rogue Squadron\" focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy.  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari.  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place.  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around.  No more static matte backgrounds.  Everything is fluid and moves with the player.  The gameplay has also been enhanced.  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships.  Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience. \"Rogue Squadron\" also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability.  It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency.  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions.  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met. There is only one minor quibble about \"Rogue Squadron\".  In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill.  The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'.  Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission.  However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit.  With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds.  With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here).  However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals.  So, it's a minor annoyance. \"Rogue Squadron\" raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet.  Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful \"Rogue Leader\" for GameCube.  \"Rogue Squadron\" is a must have for any serious gamer's library.Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64</td><td>5</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>80000190</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A126UITDLSDYLY</td><td>7300019196</td><td>grlpeach</td><td>Does a great job heating up my large living room.

This hardcover is HUGE (just over 12 inches by just under 10 inches), and Long's textured acrylic artwork, often in two-page spreads, is the focal point here. The message--Think Positively--is as vital for children now as it was when Platt & Munk published it in 1930. (Watty Piper was in reality Arnold Munk.) As to the question of the trains' gender, it doesn't matter to me. More importantly, it doesn't matter to my kids.

Graphics: 8.5/10. This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category. Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game. Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race. Fun: 8.5/10. Nice and realistic, great events, and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an N64. 9/10Finally; a great snowboarding game.</td><td>1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>80000195</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A140VZ0CQ6L8SG</td><td>7300019196</td><td>Carol A.

The first game was the ultimate experiment: will this game succeed or will Square go under? But each game was a stage in development. FF- Choosing party, and character sprites in battle (Before that, the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on) FFII- wound-developable characters (Romancing SaGa later employed this, when you survive near death your hp goes up, when you fight alot attack goes up, etc.) FF3J- simple job system (completely changes characters, no permanent skills) FF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin) FFV- Advanced job system (level up with one of the non-command skills to default class, and you permanently learn it, for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief, and then de-equip it) FFVI- basic GF system (mainly just boosts skills) FF7- basic weapon system FF8- GF system FF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic, never bought the game Likewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).Awesome!</td><td>7</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>80000198</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A12TAFRBBG9EI6</td><td>0001384198</td><td>Adam R</td><td>Excellent book that I just purchased for my four year old nephews birhtday.

You start off playing  Cloud (or whatever you decide to name him) and are an ex-soldier now  fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company  called Shinra because they're using Mako energy to power the city.  Mako  energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its  used up the planet will die.  From there you're quickly plunged into a  story about love, betrayal, duty, and saving the world. I easily got 40+  hours of gameplay and the story blew me away.  Every time yu think you know  what's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away.  There's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to  folks in towns. This game also has great replayibility with dozens of  sub-quests and side games to keep you busy.  Can you raise a gold chocobo?  Can you defeat all three weapons?  Can you find all the mega-elixers?  Can  you gain the secret characters?  Can you find everyone's super technique  and ultimate weapons?

Seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects, I  realized I must give this game a try.  Well, was I ever lucky to do so.  Keeping with the Mario 64 type control style and the amazing graphics, I  couldn't put the game down.  Even though the game was kiddie looking and  very childish too, it was really placed for us people who love adventure  games.  The little things, such as the mini games, make this game even  better than it already was.  Imagine running around in the snow in a race  against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant  ghost hand.  These are only a few of the things you can do in the game.  The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to; you  have many things to collect.  For starters, your main objective is to find  all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels.  Also, music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout  her lair.  And even little guys called Jinjo's are here for you to collect,  so they can help you on your journey, through a forest, islands, deserts,  and many other worlds.  If you have seen a Rare game, you know that they  have good graphics, so no exception here, very well done.  The music is  also a plus feature on this game.  With so many great reviews by people of  all ages and sexes, you would be doing yourself a great disjustice by not  buying this game.So much fun, it's not even funny.</td><td>5</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>80000228</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1J1QGJMKGYWFP</td><td>0001381733</td><td>sakailey</td><td>it is a great child's book, I had it about 75 years ago as a child and it was a favorite.it is a great child's book</td><td>4</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>80000229</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A6ZYA1YIG3PZ1</td><td>7500667345</td><td>Felipe</td><td>Make a circle cut at the top, twist and pop it off.

Unforunately the game didn't seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think it's worth a look even for those who already own red alert 2. The main difference that i see between TS and RA2 is the look. Where the characters in RA2 are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small. RA2 has a more straight forward look much like ra1 were Ts has that cool golden dusk look. Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA2 is based on more conventional warfare. That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game. One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive. This drone will take off on it's own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure. You must have this feature because your opponent will. Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment. There's a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry, the grenade launcher and the anti air sam. The concept for TS is the good guys, global defense initiative(GDI) vs the religious brotherhood of the nod, a fanatical terrorist group. Sounds familiar? Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI. Both sides are distinctive and different. The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics. Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent. For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground. Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack. The gdi has ways to counter this however. A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit can't resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp. Some \"new\" features that differ from the original C&C and RA. A single engineer can take over an opponents building, infantry can't just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it. Some other pros- Being a 1999 game it doesn't require much computer. Almost always runs smoothly. Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play. Cheap! Only $... or $... if you also want the firestorm pack. Very colorful and pleasant to look at. Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later. A 10 minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game. A seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet. The opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank. There are a few negatives about the game. No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers. And a limited air force. Orca helicopters are pretty cool but that's it. Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download. No coop play. Over all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods. The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior C&C releases. Worth about 4 stars but at this price it gets 5. ...............socksStill a fun game...TS v RA2?</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>80000256</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A2YXSVQ168VL8O</td><td>0001381733</td><td>Ravenshade</td><td>We have a few other hard copies of this book but it was nice to get this on Kindle so we can easily take it along in the car or on vacation.

I might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look.  Maybe even borrowing it from a friend.

It is spectacular in the graphics sense, but the story just left me out to dry.  The orginal command and conquer storyline was way better.  The GDI missions  are a joke in this game and I have to say it...NOD RULEZ!  The NOD missions  are very fun to look at and play especially the evil HAL computer that  talks to you in the cool voice.  The game play units are completely  unbalanced!  On GDI side, all you have to do is amass a huge army of Tank  Mechs and you can destroy any base no matter how fortified it is.  On the  NOD side, amass a huge army of 30 mobile artillery and nobody can stand in  your way.  The game is worth buying to see how it looks, but the gameplay  is horrible and some of the missions are close to impossible which may  frustrate some novice players.

However, it is similar, yet also quite different. Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game, you learn a few in the very beginning, and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds (there are nine, but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario 64). Notes are like coins, and jiggies are like stars. However, rather than six stars in each world, there are 10 jiggies to find in each world, and 10 in the witch's castle (much like the castle secret stars). Also, you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor Mumbo-Jumbo. Generally, it will help you get at least 1 Jiggy in the world, and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie can't on their own. Throughout the game, you get to transform into a termite (level 1), an alligator (level 4), a walrus (level 5), a pumpkin (level 7), and a bee (level 9). The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that and then some. Overall, I highly recommend it. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much.

I used about 9ft of the wire that came with the kit and I have several feet left. The description states that you need to supply your own fasteners/hardware, so unless this addition was just made to the item description, no one can complain about this. I bought some #12 1 1/2\" wood screws so that the heads fit into the pre-countersunk holes in the metal plates that you attach to the walls. One plate and three screws went into a stud and the other into a very smooth masonry wall with some Gorilla Glue. This Gorilla Glue works in *my* case - I must have put about 15 lbs of downward pressure on it and for *me* it was fine, especially since less than 3 pounds will be hanging from it. I hate drilling through masonry walls in a rented house, and so this alternative works fine for me. The fact that the installation instructions are all pictorial was not a problem, the assembly was easy. If you're used to putting things together yourself, this is a simple project. The hardest thing is positiong the wire plates at either wall exactly where you want them if no studs are present. I don't want the wire to sag, so I checked for stud locations *before* ordering this, knowing that I might also have to use masonry anchors and screws. If you can't attach this to wall studs, you might just want to go with ceiling curtain rod brackets ad a very lightweight curtain rod (all of which Ikea happens to have for a lot, lot less than Home Depot). If you want to be really cheap, twist two screw eye hooks into the wall studs (I hope they're directly opposite one another) and get some wire. But I do like the simple tension system with this set. The 17mm spacing they indicate you should use is good, especially if you're doing a long room and the wire tends to sag more during installation.

People complain that this game has no replay value, is too easy, and the graphics aren't good. Well, I've revisited this game several times since it came out in 1998, and I haven't found a lack of replay value; there's so many sub-missions, I don't see how you can't think of this game as novel and new every time you replay it. This game has a perfect balance of gameplay for first-time gamers and extra sub-missions for experienced ones. Think it's too easy? Obviously you haven't gotten all the heart pieces, found all the Skulltulas, earned all the jars, achieved the Biggoron sword, or caught the Hylian Loach. Any one of those tasks would create a challenge for anyone. Complaining about the graphics? Sorry, the game isn't on XBOX or Playstation format. In 1998, this game had state-of-the-art graphics. As I am in the process of beating this game for a third time in 2011, I still don't find the graphics something to complain about. This game excels in both gameplay and storyline.

So nine out of ten times, I'm going to miss my target. How did Nintendo screw up this badly. And the racers are pre-rendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES. I was wondering why wasn't it computer generated like Super Mario 64?

Sure, Nightfire's fun, but it never revolutionized the gaming world like Goldeneye did. Goldeneye shoots TWINE and Agent Under Fire out of the sky. Nightfire can't even hold its ground against this solid and superb N64 title. In Goldeneye, you will encounter all of the characters and locations from the Goldeneye film, and the single player campaign holds its ground. But multiplayer is where the game really shines, and it is so much better than Timesplitters or Timesplitters 2 even. I have not played Goldeneye for over a year, but the music rings in my head and I have the levels memorized perfectly. Even if you worship your Perfect Dark copy, I believe that Goldeneye is better, and I have a strong debate on that. The bottom line is that Goldeneye is the BEST FPS EVER CREATED!!

Gameplay- it is amazing, the controls are odd, but is is a pioneer in the control scheme of today's FPS's. Once you get used to moving around, the game is just too much fun (even better once you get guns, rather than using a bow). There is good multiplayer too. It always feels good to leave an opponent screaming, ready to throw their controller when you get em with the weapon that scrambles their brains (yes, there is one of those, it locks on too...)

Forget a touchdown, this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards, with three interceptions and a dozen field goals. Nothing on a home console was even close to its league. And even today, in the afterglow of behemoths like Halo, Metroid Prime and a limitless roster of PC shooters, the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations. It's difficult to call any game \"perfect.\" No matter how original, how exciting, how breathtaking it may look, sound, play or feel, there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas, and Goldeneye is no exception. Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers. No lie, I've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish, known there's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from, and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers' attack. It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits' end. In addition, there's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way. Every once in a while, an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand, blankly staring, for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers' bullets couldn't pass right through him. So you'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man, a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him, all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body. Despite my small misgivings however, 99% of this game plays flawlessly. The progression of difficulty is astounding, moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart's conclusion. And it's all done while walking that razor's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving. The player realises these missions are possible, even as he's watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes. Add to all that three difficulty levels, cheats that must be unlocked with speed, precision and overall know-how, hidden stages and hidden characters. Not only do you have a legendary FPS, you've also found nearly limitless replay value. Goldeneye is more than just a very good game, it's the stuff legends are made of. It's a game you'll want to play with your grandkids years from now. Hands down, the most attractive part about Bond's N64 debut, even today, is its controls. The Nintendo 64 controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with 007's repertoire, as every button is in precisely the right place for its function. It truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. The center grip of the N64 controller seems to BECOME the handle of a silenced PP7, Bond's revolver of choice. The \"Z\" button is a perfect trigger, and if you've purchased a Rumble Pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire. Strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand, as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle. No control system has ever felt so immersive, so right. After the first level, you hardly recognize the controller is there, it's already become such an extension of your own body. I can't sing any higher a praise than that. If you've seen the feature film of the same name, you'll notice some eerie similarities. Everything, from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen. It's honestly unsettling, how well the level designers did their jobs. Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film? You'll get your chance to find the answer on the N64. It's an experience I can't really put into words, something I'd never seen before and haven't seen since. It's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption. Finally, there's the multiplayer aspect of 007. While the single-player mode is challenging, unique and groundbreaking, multiplayer is absolutely unreal. I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released, and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than I'd wish on anyone. There were literally lines leading into my room, just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action. It was an addictive community event, whenever that little red light on the front of our N64 lit up. Truly something special. With multiple modes of play, a handful of playable levels, some hidden surprises and dozens of options, you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice, and it didn't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold-hearted war. In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no-brainer, it's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field. Goldeneye blazed that path, and did so in style. It cleared out the weeds, flattened the hills, and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today. Truly, the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such. In short, Goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a Nintendo 64, even today. There's a charm about it that can't be described, a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay. It's got the look and feel of a legend, and that's exactly the word I'd use to describe it. While there are certainly flaws, this is a game you'll kick yourself for never owning in a few years, when it becomes increasingly difficult to track down.Buried Gold on the N64</td><td>3</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>80000299</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1YNH5K0EIHLD3</td><td>917712071X</td><td>A.Porto</td><td>Nice and Shiny, Right Now.

There are 16 courses you can race in, along with 4 courses for your average Battle Mode. Now that there are 4 players, the 2-4 Player modes can be pretty fun, especially 2-Player since it has all the options from 1-Player Mode.

They're just so clunky, most of the time you can't tell where you're going, you don't know if an enemy is behind you, (Or at times even in front of you, if you get a weird camera angle) and plus might I add that you can't see your character, which does not really, (For me, most of the time) give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character.   Well, Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game.   I don't know why people complain about the graphics...it's actually kind of cool, and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they're real.  The scientists in the facility level are well detailed, and most all the characters are animated incredibly.   Besides, you take on the role of James Bond.  James Bond! The hero that defined action! This game is not dull, and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room.   The multiplayer mode, is, of course, wonderful.  You can choose from power weapons, sniper rifels, Dostovals, Shotguns, PP7's, proximity mines, hand grenades, laser guns, and basicly everything else that you can think of.  It is an entertaining game, and it is well worth the money.   The camera angles rock.  you never get lost.   So, why didn't I give this game Five stars?  Read below and find out.   THE BADS OF THE GAME   There are some major glitches.  You can see your enemies literally walk through walls, not completely, but almost there.   At times the doors, when I command it to open with the B button, it still won't open, even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place.  The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well, but how am I supposed to know that? So, I stand back, the enemy comes in, and oh, guess what, it turns out that there isn't just one of them, there's thirty, so they all shoot at me, and I die.  You can easily die in this game just due to glitches, which makes it very difficult and frustrating.   If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again.  You don't just do the thing you forgot, either, you have to do all the things that you did do, as well as the things you did not.   The game is predictible, due to the fact that it follows the movie, although when it does not follow the movie, (Which it does a lot) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.   The puzzles can be frustrating.  I'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.   The game is also very gory.  I don't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature...it should of been rated mature.   Now, for the GOODS of this game.   GOODS   Use an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry...prepare to save the world, it's gonna be a rough ride.   It follows the movie really well, (Most of the time, anyways) And if you're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game.  Even if you aren't you'll still enjoy it.   You play the role of james Bond, which is worth it within itself.   This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N64.  The controls aren't so difficult that you'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you're losing, but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun.  And even if you don't like the controls, you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen.   There's nothing that you can't shoot or destroy.   The cheats are FUNNY!  I mean, honestly, try the invisibility mode. You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near, and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that.  This makes the game easier also, and the invincibility mode is good too, although I tried and realized that you can't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time.  You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff, which is really funny to see.   The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie...they look exactly like the actors.   At the end of every level, it tells you how many kills you did, how many limb shots, how many head shots, and how many body shots you had.   The artificial intelligence with the badguys aren't all that challenging, but when there's a whole crowd of them, watch out!   This game is excellent.  Did I mention that it's excellent? Let me repeat it again: This game is excellent!

Even today, 8 years after its original release, Mario Kart 64 is still amazingly fun. The controls are PERFECT- and I do mean perfect. The first time you go power sliding around a sharp turn, you'll see what I mean. The game is perfectly balanced- each character has strengths and weaknesses. Your skill determines if you come in first- not because you picked the best character. Oh, and I haven't even spoken about the brilliant course design. Every course has shortcuts, and special features, making them truely unique. The placement of the powerups is wonderful. And the multiplayer... Oh the multiplayer! One word: brilliant. Playing with your friends is exciting, competetive, and will have you laughing like crazy. This is what multiplayer gaming is all about. If the game does have one weakness, it is the graphics; being 8 years old, Mario Kart 64 doesn't stack up well against today's crop of games in terms of visuals. But when you're having this much fun with a game, do the graphics matter? No way!! Even if you own the Gamecube version of Mario Kart, you still owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this timeless classic.A Classic!</td><td>7</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>80000318</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A3QZCA4LTTVGAD</td><td>0001714538</td><td>Michael J.

In this installment, Brother and Sister Bear, accompanied by their excitable pet dog, take a rocket trip to the moon and back. Although the book's primary purpose is entertainment and literacy education, the Berenstains do get some of the science right. The portray the gravity-free environment of the space ship's interior during the voyage, and they also show that the gravity on the lunar surface is much less than that on Earth. The book is illustrated in the typically appealing Berenstain Bears style. Particularly fun is the orange, green, and purple-colored rocket ship used by the intrepid space travelers. And the rhymes are equally fun.

I had never actually read these stories growing up, so I got this book on a whim since I love so many of the others. The first story, \"I can lick 30 Tigers Today\", talks about \"licking\" but in reference to \"beating up\" which is not how most people use the word \"licking\" anymore. The lesson is certainly still applicable: be careful not to over promise what you are capable of, or to not bite off more than you can chew. However, parents might need to explain the alternate meaning (not that small children aren't already putting everything in their mouth as it is...). Similarly, the third story centers around a Glunk who makes a very lengthy long distance call (on a LANDLINE!!) which costs a lot of money. These days, with unlimited talk plans we'll have to explain why this was such a big deal! Maybe we should reprint a version where the Glunk goes over the family data plan. (kidding!) In my opinion, the best story was the middle one because of the \"demo-catic\" lesson of not just following along with the crowd and for standing up and saying something when everyone else is being silly. Even if you are the littlest cat in Katzenstein you have the power to influence many!

After you get better you can move on to harder levels of play. once you beat the game on 150cc (hardest level) you can race al track in mirror mode (all tracks have opposite turns then their original tracks). the ads more replay value because the game in a sence has new tracks. All the tracks are unique and have varied difficulty levels. they are also well designed. The graphics in mario kart are bright simple and full of color. the music in the game is not very good but it does not mater because of the great sound effects provided by the characters. As with all great n64 games this one accells in the multiplayer department. It will appeal to people of all ages. you can choose from 3 different multiplayer modes battle championship single race.

Lots of people extol the graphics in GoldenEye, but graphics in Mario Kart 64 is better. First of all, it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better. The gameplay is simple, but that only means it's easier to learn. The card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing. So the characters don't say much. It's mainly just a simple \"Yippee!\" or \"I'm-a Wario and I'm-a gonna win!,\" but there's much more in-game speech than GoldenEye. Sound effects are fine too. The soundtrack is excellent. It ranges from coutry to smooth jazz. Even some major critics of video game music I know have said that the music here is great. You know Koji Kondo's doing something right hearing that. Mario Kart 64 is addicting with four players, and it can be addicting with one player too. The Time Trials may be a little disappointing, but the Mario GP had me coming back for more. The game is one of the best racing games on the N64. It's better than WaveRace, Diddy Kong Racing, F-Zero X, and even Excitebike 64. Heck it's one of the best games on the N64!

It isn't the story (alone), c'mon let's be honest, it's an average fantasy tale, if made into a movie I'd fall asleep after 10 minutes. I think it's all the pieces put together: a beautiful crafted world, the progress when playing - from a child into a young man -, the challenges you'll face and overcome, the music that playes a big role in the game, the use of time: day and night, future and past etc. etc. It grabs you and most important: it's interactive (duh) for it's a game, you're not watching a crap fantasy movie, but playing the hero all by yourself, when he looses, you loose etc. I played a lot of games in my life, including many new(er) titles as Halo, GTA, Metroid Prime etc etc and I didn't yet played a game that matched the sheer brilliance of The Legend of Zelda - The Ocarina Of Time.

The title caught my eye, and the cover showed the silhouette of a castle and a quote from Ursula Le Guin: \"A bitter, complex, brilliant book.\" Well, I thought, I'm bitter, complex, and brilliant, so this just might be for me.  So I plunked down my eighty-five cents and took it home, never knowing it was a cult novel that would challenge me like few others. There's three interwoven stories, each in the same location. The first and central story is a romance between two teenagers in 1973 England, with one going off to college. The kids are wistful, honest, confused, very intelligent, and trying to hold onto the one thing they know is sure in the world. They stood in the shelter of the tower, holding each other, rocking with gentleness. \"I love you,\" said Jan. \"I'm coming to terms with it.\" \" - love you.\" \"But there's a gap.\" \"Where?\" \"I know things, and feeling things, but the wrong way round. That's me: all the right answers at none of the right times. I see and can't understand. I need to adjust my spectrum, pull myself away from the blue end. I could do with a red shift.\" The second story focuses on a small band of the lost Roman Ninth Legion trying to blend in with the first century tribes of Britain. Religion, subversion, and revelation rise among the brutality of war. One of them, Macey, is prone to berserker-like fits. Anyone who likes military fiction, or gritty fantasy, will appreciate the realistic depictions of their battles, all laced in Vietnam-like delirium. \"You and Magoo stand sentry,\" said Logan, \"but listen. All of you get this, and get it good. The guards have been taken out, maybe not by Cats. The Mothers have come south. They'll raid the Cats wherever they find them, and both sides will whip our ass if we let them. Solutions.\" \"The usual,\" said Face. \"Divide and rule. Hit the infrastructure.\" \"Correct. All right? We retreat until we're clear of the Mothers, then we go tribal.\" The third story takes us to St. Bertoline's church, in Barthomley, 1643, when the Irish are invading the countryside. It's much like \"The Crucible\" in terms of a love triangle mixed with religious fervor, and it ties in with the other stories with a stone artifact that appears throughout the novel. A single bell began to ring over the parish. \"Is it church time already?\" said Margery. \"No. My father. He thinks we'll be up against reasonable men.\" \"Have you seen them?\" \"Nearly. I rode down through Crewe by Oak Farm. They'd not left any alive. I must go and stop that bell. They'll find us soon enough.\" There's profound connections between these characters I won't reveal here, but the novel weaves questions of identity, time, and the bond between the three couples to the point where the book doesn't always mark where one scene ends and another begins. Early editions were marketed young adult, and yet it's as adult and dense as a Salinger story or Shakespeare. The novel ends on a heartbreaking note, leaving you in wonder as to what exactly happened, and yet that's exactly the charm and strength of the work - like rich poetry, you need to read it more than once to get all the meaning, and even then there's much beyond your reach. It's a challenging work, and at a scant 120 pages, maintains the tension all the way through. For readers outside England, here's some pointers on British words: a caravan is a military trailer, nesh is being very sensitive to cold weather or simply lacking courage, a folly is a castle built for decoration, cans are headphones, M6 can be both a highway and a star cluster, M33 is a spiral galaxy, and \"Tom's a-cold\" is from \"King Lear.\"  Also, image searches of Crewe and Mow Cop would give an idea of the setting, but don't read the Introduction or look up the meaning of the coded message until you've finished the book. To sum up, captivating and cryptic, with realistic, unique characters and situations, all presented with a masterful use of mystery and suspense. Add to that spell-binding dialogue, rich with layer on layer, and it's a work that resonates with you long after.Challenging, Grim, and Compelling</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>80000344</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>AJBFQP2JXBX6Q</td><td>0001841572</td><td>John Bonavia</td><td>A bitter, dense, vigorous book about the violence and betrayals we inflict on each other.  So much is lost along the way - and although there is some survival at the end, what kind of survival is it? There are three interwoven stories, spanning three points in time and one in space - the times are the later Roman Empire in Britain, the British Civil War of the 17th century, and the modern age.  The space is a part of Cheshire around an iconic hill, Mow Cop. And the three are linked - apart from their biting emotional motifs -  by an object, a prehistoric axe head, that appears in all, a talisman of the ages. In the earliest thread, a ragged remnant of a Roman legion - just a few soldiers, conscripts from who-knows-where - have to deal with the wild and ancient tribes, as vicious and crafty as the soldiers. Wonderfully, Garner has made them talk the lingo of modern squaddies, because that's how they would have sounded to each other. In the Civil War, villagers take refuge in a church from the prowling band of enemy - but not all the hatred is political...In today's world, a near-genius innocent, a sacred fool (who quotes Lear's lines for Tom the fool) is paired with a girl above his social level and distrusted by his parents: there are no swords here, but \"words\" is an anagram of \"sword\" and the pain is the same. Incredible tight, elliptical exchanges: you may have to read a page twice to \"get\" everything that is happening (and then you won't be sure).

From the amazing graphics (for what it is; a N64 game), to the music, to the challenging gameplay, to the engulfing storyline, the \"Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\" is a must-play for any age. You start the game off as young Link (or whatever you want to call him), who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old. Inside the forest, there is a godly tree, who could be considered to be infinitly wise. The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising, and tests him to the dungeon inside of him. Link comes out, sucessful, and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising. From then on, you play young Link, and must overcome many obstacles. As a child, there are 3 dungeons, and the tree's counts as one, so you're making some time, right? WRONG. There's much more to this game then beating dungeons. As a child, you can't acess as many of the things, but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword, many of these things are then open to you. As a child, you got an ocarina, in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things. Now, you can do all those things, and more. My personal favorite is Epona's song, in which you place a horse's (Epona) song, and it comes to you, in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast. As a child, you have weapons like a stick (whoopey), a sword, a shield, a sling-shot, and Duku Nuts. As an adult, you can handle 2 swords: the Master Sword, and the Giant Sword, which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands, which means no shield. You also have the hook-shot, Megaton Hammer, bow-and-arrows, and magic crystals you can do different things with. I cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is. I'd buy a Nintendo 64 all over again just for this. Now I have a Playstation 2, and I still have my Nintendo 64, but only play two games on it; this, of course, and Super Smash Brothers.

I find this book really captures childrens' imaginations as they try to work out what they would do in this situation.  There are also quite a few valid and intelligent questions, such as how can you drink all the water out of the taps? Why would a tiger prefer Sophie's sandwiches to Sophie herself? Would a tiger get drunk from drinking beer?  (Some of these questions are from older kids than the intended audience...) This whimsical old-fashioned story has a European feel with the landscape and clothing - there is also something decidedly old-fashioned about the family structure with Daddy at work all day (and the \"Ta-da!\" pose when he arrives home from work), but this does not detract from the story for me.  If it bothers you, you can talk about how family dynamics are different now, although careful not to spoil the magic possibility that a tiger could possibly come to tea.Magical possibilities and endless questions...</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>80000363</td><td>4.0</td><td>true</td><td>AMRHHES2MOAUK</td><td>B00000JGRP</td><td>HollyBelle</td><td>haven't used this but a couple of times.

The bowl is difficult to line up and click into place, the blades's anchor is light cheap plastic and if I let it run for even an extremely short amount of time (say, to chop a few nuts) it starts overheating and a burning smell ensues.  I would say that it's only use would be for extremely light chopping jobs or perhaps making mayonaise or salad dressings.

As you may have heard, I am definitely NOT a fan of the very first Crash Bandicoot game released for the Sony Playstation in 1996.  I am, however, incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never-ending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 1998. Just so you know, I can't compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back because I haven't played that one.  I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot. Before playing Crash 3, I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game.  I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off, and didn't deserve all the attention it got. For 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew, and truth be told, it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring, repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage. Simply put, Crash's very first outing was BORING.  It desperately needed variety.  Walking through island/jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring.  The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite- Warped features nothing BUT creativity.  In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel.  You will encounter something drastically different in every stage.  I like that. The main objective of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game.  You HAVE to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game won't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you're in.  For example, if you're in World 4, and can't find the purple gem in stage 3, you won't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world.  You're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem.  Once you find the gem, and face and defeat the boss, you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss.  By the way, there's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world.  That comes to 25 stages total. The amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible.  Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground, Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety.  In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages (where you're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem), a couple underwater stages (with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly, puffy fish swimming about), a couple levels where you're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes, and not to mention those tricky, tiger-riding stages. Oh, and I HAVE to mention the ultra-cool futuristic robot stages (which require near-perfect jumping patterns in order to complete).  The Jet Ski stages are really fun because you're located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs.  Yup, it's awesome.  This is what makes Crash Bandicoot 3 so great- you won't know WHAT to expect until you enter the level. Probably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge.  That's not to say the game is a cakewalk, either.  People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games.  If you compare Warped to say, I don't know, Spyro the Dragon, it's not such an easy game then.  It's definitely not a hard game either.  You WILL beat it.  I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros. 1, the old NES classic. The one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World 3 where you're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction.  This is one case where practice doesn't necessarily make perfect.  Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you don't bother shooting down the enemy planes. One thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems.  Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems, because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage.  I mean, they are always RIGHT THERE.  RIGHT in front of you! After you complete a stage, you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time.  Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard.  It means you *really* have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin-attack an enemy or ANYTHING.  It means you have to run run RUN!  Just so you know, completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement.  It's entirely up to you if you'd like to accept the challenge.  I'm too much of a wimp to accept it, personally. I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage.  You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room, if you wish.  Very convenient.  Oh, and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation, when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there!  I can't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect.  Speaking of lives, they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them.  That's a lot, and you will probably need them because, even though the challenge ranges from low to medium, your first time through the game won't be THAT simple. When Crash gets hit or smashed by something, I think it's funny the way he yells \"whoa!\"  It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top. The reason Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped isn't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon- in the flying stages (in this case, the airplane stages) when you hit down on the D-pad the airplane flies UP, and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN.  The game company made the direction the wrong way!  Oops.  At least when you steer the airplane left, it will go left.  The same with right.  Unfortunately, many game makers have made, and continue to make, the same mistake.  It needs to be corrected once and for all. I realize having your airplane fly up when you hit \"down\" on the d-pad is an example of realism since that's more or less how REAL airplanes operate, but the thing is, Crash Bandicoot isn't supposed to be about realism since it's just a platform adventure game, and furthermore, it still doesn't change the fact that up and down are reversed.  This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards. There's a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge, and in my mind at least, having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge. I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time.Crash's best game</td><td>2</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>80000391</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A3FZF610C2PGJZ</td><td>0001712764</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>My 4 year old really enjoyed!Love!</td><td>6</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>80000392</td><td>4.0</td><td>false</td><td>AA50ZQDY2TPK5</td><td>B00000DMAR</td><td>Aaron</td><td>Crash Bandicoot: Warped = Orange, cool, creative, fuzzy, neat, great graphics, awesome design, introduction of secret levels for the series, power-ups, new bosses (including a big boss), and a new playable character.

If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing. But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didn't include certain things that the PC version and better version had. First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out. Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town. And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch. When I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga! Convinced the PC versions better?

The tabs that hold the spill guard in place break off, the tabs for the lid then break, and then the handle.  It appears the problem is really just bad plastic.

It's a classic, no Mario fan should be without it. Now, onto the reveiw: Controls:9.5/10 It's pretty good compaired to some games, but most games have much smoother control. But since this is one of the first N64 games, I'm going to give it a good rating considering there are no PS2s, GCs, or Xboxs. There's mario's famous jump, double jump, and triple jump. The double and triple jumps can be performed by timing when you press the A button. There is also the groundpound aka buttstomp and other confusing jumps. Also, Mario can pick up and throw various items, climb walls using the wall jump,and punch and kick. The reson why this game's getting a 9.5 is because some jumps can be hard to master, and controlling Mario can sometimes be hard. Graphics:10/10 Like I said:This is one of the first Nintendo 64 games! So, it's okay that the graphics are a little blocky and not very detailed. The graphics are very well done. Replay Value:7/10 The point of the game is to retrieve all of the castle's power stars and save princess Peach. There are 120 in all. You only need 70 to beat the game. Sure, it's fun to go back and beat the game a couple more times. But how much time are you going to spend getting all 120?Some stars are very hard to get, and after a couple of times, you might get frusterated and just give up! Overall:10/10 Super Mario 64 is a brilliant game. Mario can be turned into metal Mario, invisible and fly by wearing special caps that last a certain amount of time. He can shoot from cannons and swing Bowser around by the tail. The courses are cleverly designed, everything is almost perfect. I use the word \"almost\" because nothing is perfect.Mario goes 3D</td><td>6</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>80000445</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>AFKVTC6NDI2B6</td><td>B0000224M6</td><td>Amazon Customer</td><td>Love themFive Stars</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>80000446</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1YUS3CIEEBDCQ</td><td>0001720392</td><td>Charlotte Blyther</td><td>gave to my grandson he is learning how to readFive Stars</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>80000447</td><td>4.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1HRYNC4I8D1ET</td><td>B0000224M6</td><td>masharra</td><td>When this arrived it was only a single pack with 8 wipes in it although it is listed as a pack of 3.

It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series, it hits video gaming gold.  From the earliest release of the original \"Super Mario Brothers\" on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, it has always been a hit.  Even lesser known titles in the series, like \"Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island\", stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay.  With the dawn of Nintendo's three dimensional, 360 degree rotating platform, Nintendo 64, the question became, \"Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle?\"  The answer, in the form of \"Super Mario 64\", proved to be a quite emphatic \"YES!\" \"Super Mario 64\" takes the technique of 'multiple goals' for each level (introduced in \"Super Mario World\") and expands it in a quite impressive manner.  There are 15 worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle.  The goal is to accumulate at least 70 stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser.  As each world contains 7 stars of its own in addition to 15 bonus stars around the castle, it would seem to be a walk in the park.  However, all is not as it seems.  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements.  Therefore, there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won.  Of course, this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean, soars in the open sky, battles over scorching lava, and even gets to sneak through a haunted house.  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing, as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals.  No longer content to just move forward and jump, Mario can now do backflips, long jumps, wall leaps, and crawls. One other aspect of \"Super Mario 64\" that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Mario's movements through each world.  It takes some getting used to, but it enables a truly three dimensional feel.  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo 64 around.  It delivered magnificently then and, with its continual replay value, still delivers today.Mario soars in a 3D world</td><td>3</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>80000449</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>AMMYOLKH0AAIV</td><td>B0000224M6</td><td>Queen</td><td>Smells nice!

What bad can be said about Mario 64? The polygons are smooth as silk, very, very, VERY rare slowdown, and the Mario we know and love. Can anyone guess what plumber's job is in this game? It's to traverse 15 levels in search of Princess Peach. On the way, you have to stomp on Bowser's head. Thrice. All your favorite enemies are back, with the exception of Koopa Troopas. The goombas, shy guy, the Lakita Brothers, the moles, Bob-ombs, everyone's back! At a graphics standpoint, Super Mario 64 is absolutely outstanding in every way, shape, and form. Kudos to Nintendo. 5 out of 5 for graphics. A great soundtrack and a great Mario voice make for a great overall sound. 5 out of 5 for sound. The huge worlds will keep you coming back for more. There is no way to put this thing down. 5 out of 5 for replay. The final score? Go look at the stars. See ya later. Go buy this game. Merry Christmas.

I enjoy playing my copy of the game, and still find new interest and challenges of running cities.  The replay value should be obvious as there is no \"end goal\" to meet, though there are \"rewards\" along the way.  There are several problems, however, particularly when compared to Sim City 2000.  First, there are no scenarios.  That is a pity because the scenarios often enhanced the value of the game.  Second, you cannot for your own landform in the New City mode before you start the game (again, unlike SC2000).  Both of these problems were later corrected for the later cousin of the game: Sim City 3000 Unlimited. Additionally, the online support is much better for Unlimited.  The building downloads on the official website are minimal, and the building design tool is not supported by the basic game.  Still, I will have to admit that 3000 is still a vast improvement over the previous version.  The buildings are better designed, and they really do look different on different sides.  Also, the graphics are much better over 2000, while they are not vastly improved in Unlimited (which is essentially the same game, with the additions above AND additional buildings).  I would recommend that you do buy Unlimited over this version simply because of the vast number of updates.  And, with the release of Sim City 4, it is highly unlikely that even the Unlimited website will stay up much into the future, and it certainly will not be supported any more.Not Well Supported</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>80000457</td><td>4.0</td><td>true</td><td>A10XROX6G3HAGQ</td><td>B0000224M6</td><td>Sara F.</td><td>The nose was a great addition to the teddy bear I made for my daughter.

What You Should Know Before You Buy:  Attractive looking and nice quality silicone spatula set that worked well overall.  Each spatula has a one piece style with a sturdy handle and silicone covering the entire spatula.  There were essentially no seams.  Has two different size standard shape Spatulas and a large Spoonula (spatula/spoon combo).  Silicone heads were safe to use with our T-Fal non-stick pans.  Spatulas were fairly easy to clean, but scrambled eggs did stick a bit and had to be brushed for cleaning after sitting for an hour. Conclusion: Overall, this is a nice 3-piece silicone spatula set. It has a nice style and a quality build.  They were constructed to be a single piece for each spatula with silicone covering the entire utensil. I tested it out on various foods and they did quite a nice job. They worked well and cleaned up pretty easily, but did need a little scrubbing for some stuck on scrambled eggs that I used the spoonula for. I love a spoonula shaped spatula for eggs because it allows for scraping with the flat edge, but also allows for scooping out of the pan.  If you are in the market for a nice set of silicone spatulas, this set performed nicely.What You Should Know Before You Buy!</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>80000476</td><td>4.0</td><td>true</td><td>AV56CQTOGFTCJ</td><td>B00000I1BB</td><td>Jake</td><td>This is truly a funny game.

It is hard to even label him as a children's author, because adults love his work as well. We just use our kids as the excuse to buy the books! Green Eggs and Ham is certainly one of his classics that has been enjoyed by several generations of readers and it is easy to see why. His books are fun to read and look at. The characters start in a simple setting but quickly progress into some silly adventure in a world that only Seuss could come up with and make so enjoyable for others. The rhyming flows wonderfully and it is fun to read out loud and play with pace of voice. Kids giggle and ask for more. Those who can't yet read, still like to look at the pages and do their best to from memory. Green Eggs and Ham aces the entertainment factor. I almost gave it 5 stars. Even now, it feels somewhat sacrilegious to take it down to only four stars. It feels wrong in the way some people feel about a kid not being allowed to eat candy on Halloween. It's fun, shouldn't I just enjoy it? Maybe, but I am going to be a stick in the mud instead. We try to teach our kids that no means no and that peer pressure is bad. This book does not honor that. Sam is like the salesman that won't take no for an answer. He keeps pushing and pushing to close the deal. He does not let up when the other person starts getting angry. Finally, he gets him to break and try what he is offering. He doesn't just like what Sam gives him, he loves it. And that is another lesson we often try to teach. You won't know if you like it unless you try it. That is what I tell my kids about healthy foods. But that lesson is certainly not more important than the others. Sam was told no and he should have left it at that, allowing the other guy to come around on his own. I know it seems like such a minor thing, but our kids are listening. They find this book fun and a lot of kids also find it fun to pressure other kids to like what they like and do what they do even if the other isn't comfortable with it. Definitely read this book with your kids. Have fun with it, celebrate the genius of Seuss, and then simply explain to them that we should respect other people's choices.No Means No and the Matter of Peer Pressure</td><td>4</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>80000496</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A1KW49KJL5B6VX</td><td>B0000224M6</td><td>Bryan Peterson</td><td>This is a must have for any red wine drinker!

Using vehicles for combat and multiplied destruction couldn't be better.  Even though its graphics could be sharpened and more detailed, the gameplay, and value of this game are in the spotlight.  Each level are unique from each other, and I must say that they include a lot of beautiful textures; they range from an underground arena, to skycrapers.  Using the sophisticated weaponry with advanced techniques will keep you glued to your screen; you get to retrieve weapons you see that appear, and use them for your enemies.  As for sound, the SFX is a little over average, it isn't as detailed or spectacular.  With the music though, that's one concept of this game that makes it outstanding; orchestra, symphony type music with a touch of hard core music makes this game prosperous. You can play 2-player deathmatches which really kick arse.  If you're alone and want to do a tournament match, you will fight and may win until you ask Calypso, the leader in the car combat series, for your ultimate wish to come true.

There's nothing special about it at all. I got this game awhile back and thought it was pretty lame so the game went into retirement, until I decided to pull it out for the first time in many many years and play it and my thoughts remain the same. For WCW's first video game made during the Monday Night Wars, this was pretty terrible. For starters, this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game you'd expect. The game came out in 1997, yet looks and feels like it was made in 1990, transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game. WCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies, Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze, which would probably explain why there are only 13 WCW wrestlers in the game, while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers. That's right folks. Only 13 WCW wrestlers, while the rest are made-up Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of. It's kind of a waste of a game if you're not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space. The only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas. There's a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas. To add on to the Japanese theme in this game, there's cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it would've been acceptable in a 1980s Japanese action movie. There are 7 different modes you can play in this game that are: League Challenge, Best of Seven, Exhibition Match, Elimination Match, Tournament, League Match, and Double Title Match. It goes without saying that the move-sets in this game are also very limited. Each wrestler only has about 6 to 7 different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored. Ultimately, once you've played one match, you've played them all. Overall, this game is just horrible. It gets boring within the first 10 minutes before you want to cut it off. A similar WCW game, made and published by the same company would come out later that year; WCW vs NWO: World Tour for the Nintendo 64. It was slightly better than vs The World, but that's not saying much. Basically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation, buy Thunder, Nitro, Mayhem, or Backstage Assault. Nitro and Backstage Assault weren't all that good but any following WCW game is 1000x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The WorldWorst WCW Game Ever Made</td><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>80000503</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A8XK1O945GR0C</td><td>B0000224M6</td><td>Ryan T</td><td>Good light for my daughters room.

You have limited space to carry the scant supplies the game gives you.  Not much ammo.  Not much health.  And zombies and rabid dogs everywhere.  This game was awesome. It does have its issues.  The controls took some time to get used to.  Not everyone cared for the fixed camera angles.  And the voice acting is bad.  So bad its laughable.  Its definitely dated now.  The blood looks fake, the rooms are brightly lit.  And the hunters look almost comical, except their scream, that's still scary.  Also the remake for the Gamecube way outshone it.

The replay value is so incredibly high it never seems to get old.  The graphics maybe out dated but the play control is excellent.  The music is very good and the stages are excellent each with its own unique features.  Once you learn the freeze sequence you can tee off on the competition.  The game is great as a single player and even more fun with multiple people.  The intro and endings are fantastic very well done.  TM2 improves on the first game in every way. I have spent countless hours playing the game, swearing at my TV and coming back for more.  I love the no holds barred aspect of the game every car vs every other car.  Who doesn't love blowing up Sweet Tooth or Twister.  Each character had their own unique abilities advantages and disadvantages.  There are so many ways to destroy your opponents and it is very satisfying to get revenge on someone who just blew you up. The challenge for the game was very even and as the player you always feel like you have a chance to win the round.  The sequels for Twisted Metal never seemed to capture the fun aspect or outstanding play control in this game. I think the only flaw in the game was that there was not enough lives to play simultaneously against the computer with no passwords and limited continues.  The first player game is fabulous I would rate that a 10. TM3 & TM4 all had the same flaw, the cars seem to gang up on you and not fight each other where as in this game it is full on mayhem going on the whole time. What's worse in TM3 the computer opponents would puss out when they had a quarter of a life bar left and steal your health power up which is BS. I would highly recommend this game to anyone 10 and older.

So, I said to hLL with that!  I'm gonna buy some spa quality products that had an aromatherapy benefit and we'd just give each other the Spa Day!  And it would only cost 1/6th the price for all the products I purchased, including FHF Chocolate Facial (we both loved it), The Naked Bee Orange Blossum Honey Body Lotion, 80 Acres Blood Orange Oil and last but not least FHF Honey Heel Glaze. This scrub is heavenly and smells just right.  I tried to get products I could get past my Manly Man. After using this scrub on each other in the shower - we fell asleep!  That's sensual - right? You may think that a couple that's 55 years young would have benefitted more from a spa tech doing our Spa Day, BUT we put a date on the calendar to have the same type of 1/2 day together in exactly 4 weeks.  On top of that we have ALL the product we'll need for at least 6-7 \"Home Spa Days\"! We had SOOO much fun as this salt scrub was exactly the right mixture of salt and oil.

But this continues to puzzle me. I know the illustrations picture green eggs AND green ham. But the story ONLY says green eggs, not necessarily the ham part. Green meat of any kind means it is likely spoiled! Hmmm... ask: \"When shouldn't you eat green ham? Or even green eggs?

The PS1 Namco Museum series is a very interesting twist on the arcade compilation formula. The innovative things about these games is that you have the option of walking around in a literal Namco Museum, and there are doors which represent each game, whats awesome about walking around in the museum is that each door for each game you go into has excellent build-up and atmosphere to get you pumped to play the game, and since it is a museum, each game's room has a plethera of interesting history of Namco, for example, in the Dig Dug room, you can click on these action figures that are on display and they represent real toys that Namco actually produced. There are also these sort of tips and tricks scattered on the walls of each room, as well as more history other than merchandise. Its a brilliant idea, and luckily, this game has an amazing roster of games. It has Ms. Pacman, Dig Dug which is my favorite arcade game of all time, Galaxian, Pole Position 2, Tower of Druaga, and Phozon which is a really strange sort of puzzle game. Lastly, because of personal bias, this game means a lot to me. It introduced me to Namco and some arcade classics, and some of the museum locations invoked wonder and curiosity in me and they make me happy whenever I see them.

Originally, the DC version had a much more explicit graphic beginning, with blood and all.  But due to censorship and problems with young kids bying M-Rated games and watching R-Rated movies, the scenes were cut out.  The only real different thing about the Director's Cut is the different costumes availible and items are in different spots. This will leave already RE owners high and dry, while satisfying non-RE game owners.  Anyways, the story. In RE, a group of Special tactics commandos, known as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) are dispacthed to a secluted mansion in the middle of a remote forrest.  The mansion once harvested top secret government experiments, lead by a Evil Corporation known as \"Umbrella\".  After the first squad, Bravo Team, was shot down from their helicopter and diseapeared without communication.  The second squad, Alpha Team, was sent to rescue them.  But a few scuffles with unknown creatures, leads their helicopter leaving them in the middle of the forrest.  In panic, the team finds refuge in the mansion. But little does the team know is that their troubles just begun.  You have the choice to either play Chris Redfield, a ex-marine turned SWAT commander, or Jill Valentine, a strong guided commando with the ability to pick lock doors and locks.  Through out the game, you must survive in the mansion. Your enemies are Bio-infested Zombies....that's right, zombies.  The problem; you're running low on ammo.  The story goes together, much like the basis for Sam Raimi's \"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn\" or George Romeo's \"Night of the living Dead\".  Complete with FMV cut-scenes, that include, no less, Screen Actor Guild rejected actors with terrible acting and bad dialouge (\"You almost turned into a Jill-sandwich!!!\"), but never the less still a fun game.

In this book by Dr. Seuss,  the character is having a rough time in his town so when he is enticed by another to find a better land where nothing bad ever happens, he goes on a journey to find the place.  The problem is, everything bad that could happen along the way does.  When he finally arrives, he realizes that being home is not such a bad thing.  He returns, but arms himself against the bad things that may come his way. This book is one of the longer Dr. Seuss books so it may need more than one sitting to finish it.  The message is a great one.  Bad things can and will happen wherever you are.  Instead of running, prepare yourself to stand up against these bad things.

I don't know for sure when they were installed, but I assume when the home was built. The shelving and support brackets are made of steel but the old brackets have plastic connectors between the front of the bracket and the shelf. These plastic connectors have gotten brittle over time and are breaking and we have been experiencing occasional shelving crashes when the plastic connector eventually breaks.  Fortunately, these brackets have been redesigned so that they don't require the plastic connectors. So, when an old connector breaks, you have to throw away the old connector and the old metal bracket and replace it with this new bracket. I have decided to purchase these brackets in bulk for a good price on Amazon, instead of paying twice as much when you buy a package of two at a big box store. I guarantee that you will eventually have to replace most of your old brackets. In order to prevent future catastrophic crashes, I plan to start replacing every other bracket which should make the installation stronger and safer.  I will do this first in the closets which have heaviest clothing - i.e. suits, coats, jackets and also where heavy items are stored on the shelf.Good Economical Fix for Old Brackets that are Failing</td><td>4</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>80000586</td><td>2.0</td><td>true</td><td>A2ILSPG1TJ9V69</td><td>B00002N5WN</td><td>Johnny Xmas</td><td>These bend at the flat part very easily if you leave them hanging during installation.Two Stars</td><td>7</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>80000587</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A2GRIT6JVGKTSA</td><td>0001720392</td><td>McNair2000</td><td>This is a book that I have always loved.

I'm looking forward to his latest video game installment, Crash Tag Team Racing.  The game's graphics are good, the gameplay itself sounds amuzing, and the trailer (on GameSpot) prove how visually stunning it's going to be too.  But, Crash's humble beginning is not the same as Mario and Sonic's were.  It was much better, more creative, and bigger. Mario's was just an arcade game.  It was hard, but it didn't take to long to master it, and I don't even know if there was a boss.  Sonic's debut was better then Mario's.  A game you could play without spending money, good levels, challenging, better bosses, and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary.  But, these debuts lacked what Crash's had.  Most challenging, best bosses, better secret ending, and most of all, a 3-D world to play in. Crash's world is not fully 3-D in this game (in fact up till Crash Twinsanity, none of them have been), but it is very good as far as it goes.  The VIRTUAL world looks like the REAL world.  That's one of the game's strongest points.  The controls are very solid and Crash responds amazingly well to your commands.  This spoiled me.  I'd play a Crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response.  I became versatile after a while though.  Crash lacks moves in this game, but he has more then Sonic and/or Mario had in their debut games.  Crash has 3, Mario and Soinc only had 1.  Crash's moves are running, jumping, and spinning.  The spinnig move is an extremely creative thing.  To make up for Sonic's spin, Naughty Dog brought out the bigger and better guns.  Crash's spin is much easier to control and is much more effective.  It also doesn't threaten you in a strange, almost indescribable way.  Sonic's spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning.  Sega called this the spin dash.  This could throw you to your death.  Not Crash's.  Crash could move or stay still when spinning.  Note: Soinc didn't have the spin dash in his debut game.  Mario and Sonic's jumping, I'll admit, was better.  They were tighter then Crash.  Their direction could be changed much, much easier then Crash when jumping.  Crash jumps higher though.  Crash runs kind of slow, especially when you need to get something done. But he's slower in Crash Twinsanity.  Crash's camera control is hardly ever a problem.  Every once in a while you'll have to strain your eye a little, but it's still a better camera then Soinc's.  Mario's is best out of all, though, 'cause you could see the entire level all at once. As for the other features of the game, they're pretty outstanding.  The levels are big and challenging.  There's also secret levels in Crash.  I've never seen anything like that in Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, have you?  No, I didn't think so.  Crash's biggest flaw is the saving system.  In the game, you must collect 3 tokens of Crash's girfriend's head (hidden in the level) to get to a bonus area.  You must get to the end of the Tawna (Crash's girlfriend's name is Tawna) Bonus Round, touch Tawna (who's just standing there), and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save.  If you don't do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save, you don't get to save. Not fair at all.  But, it's still better then Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, 'cause you can't save at all in those games.  There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game, The Cortex (main bad guy of the game) Bonus Rounds and the Brio (Cortex's right-hand man) Bonus Rounds.  You can't save in these bonus rounds, even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms.  Oh and get this, there aren't Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels, so you don't have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and you're in a level like Hog Wild where there's no bonus rounds.  Big flaw.  The 2nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems.  In the game you must collect 32 (I think; don't quote me on that number, because I'm not sure) gems in order to see the secret ending.  However, it's a little too hard to collect them all.  I understand most people think the game's not hard enough, but I think it's a little too hard.  To collect a gem, you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life.  I'm all for destroying every crate, but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem.  It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes. So, if you're wanting to compare Mario and Sonic to Crash, I'd say Crash all the way.  And, as you can see, if you're reading this, Crash's 1st game was much better then Mario and Sonic's.  I say Crash is best, no matter what anyone else tells me.My Favorite</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>80000597</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A1T9KWJ3SSLYYP</td><td>B00002N5ZJ</td><td>Nancy W.</td><td>Works great for my 40 year old canner.Five Stars</td><td>1</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>80000598</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A45HC4DHL0X4A</td><td>B00002N5ZJ</td><td>Jeff A.

Some of the game was a little challenging for me at first. i remember the ads, and wanting to have this game and the un-wasted excitement when i finally held the case in my hands. Spyro is the main character(obviously) a little purple dragon with Sparx(a dragonfly and his best friend) following him around, Sparx represents Spyro's health and proctects Spyro. He can only take so many hits or damage spyro should of recieved before Spyro is on his own and can only get hit once, to avoid this however you can ram or flame the sheep(called fodder) and they will turn into butterflies which Sparx eats in one bite for a life. The mission of the game is to free your fellow dragons who were all turned to crystal statues(Spyro wasn't tall enough to get hit by the spell), get the eggs and dragon treasure back, and beat Gnasty Gnorc who hates dragons and besides turning them into statues stole all the dragon treasure and the dragon eggs.Spyro</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>80000609</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A3AZW3V0E76VN9</td><td>0001720392</td><td>Room207</td><td>Green eggs and ham by Dr. Suess is a rhyming book about Sam trying to convince someone to eat green eggs and ham.

This is a very fun game in which an evil creature called Gnasty Gnorc scatters gems all over the dragon world, turns some into his minions, lets blue thieves into the dragon world to steal their precious dragon eggs, and encases all the dragons in crystal. He missed Spyro, so it's his job to turn the dragon world the way it was. The graphics are colorful and the sound and music are also nice, and as for replay value, it has a fairly good amount. If there is one thing to complain about, it is the difficulty level. The enemies don't put up too much of a threat, and finding gems and dragons is usually fairly easy, and even the bosses are pretty easy to toast. But it can prove quite a challenge to some people, and may include some testing with some things. But besides these two facts, Spyro the Dragon is a nice, colorful game that is well worth the money.Spyro the Dragon Review</td><td>1</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>80000612</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A3O6DX39Z9DJUI</td><td>B00002N636</td><td>Maddog From Florida</td><td>I'm sure they are great, but I ordered the wrong bags.Five Stars</td><td>1</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>80000613</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A19452EHXTTF31</td><td>B00002N636</td><td>Carl L.

I fell into the trap that many parents did and bought a ton of the Dr. Suess series books in boardbook form before my son was born, only to realize that the stories are abridged and not as good as the original. The board books were a great introduction for him as an infant, short reads and sturdy, easy to clean. But a lot of the charm of Dr. Suess books is lost in the boardbook version. Many authors offer the whole book in boardbook form, so it took me awhile to realize why the Dr. Suess ones weren't as appealing to me or my son. So with the Dr. Suess books I had to buy all the books again in hardcover so he would have the whole story as a toddler.

The gameplay is clunky and clumsy, but it is a horror game designed to make you feel inadequate and somewhat unprepared for the adventure you are thrown into. The story is Sci-Fi Originals bad and in hard to understand, but that was what they were going for. Honestly, everything about the game should not work. It does alot wrong, but it does MORE right. Yes, it all meshes together into a really good game. Yes, in a few years it will be a painful to play as, say, Pitfall for the Atari, but even when it is thriteen years old it is still F-U-N to play. I played it non-stop when I had my PS1, continued to play it with my PS2, and even now, after I got an Xbox 360 and play other games, I still plug up my PS2 and play some RE2 once and awhile.

The 2 discs, and the 2 people to play as, where each of their actions affect the other person's adventure, for example was just amazing. I'm also not kidding when I call this game a \"scare\".  \"Resident Evil 2\" will have you on the edge of your seat, and it may even have you wetting your trousers a bit at certain times. \"Resident Evil 2\" is an essential pickup for any fan of the Survival-Horror genre.  \"Resident Evil 2\" did so much for the genre, that it shall be  remembered forever.A Classic Scare</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>80000620</td><td>4.0</td><td>false</td><td>A3SNO7AAYOXQUN</td><td>B00000I1BJ</td><td>Avatar of the Llama</td><td>My first experience with the Resident Evil series was with Code: Veronica X.  I was severely disappointed overall with it, and from what I've read, the whole series is the same, so I had little to no faith in it.  I didn't feel the need whatsoever to play the other games, and openly spoke out against the series, even though I only played one game.  But, after playing Resident Evil 4, I got intrigued by the story, so I decided to try out Resident Evil 1-3.  I thought, \"There's no way they can be worse than Code: Veronica, so why not?\"  And good god... was I right. Although the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke (thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code: Veronica X look like an Oscar-winning performance), that wasn't really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture, the second iteration really blew me away.  Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I don't care at all about graphics in a videogame, so I'm not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant (which is why I'm not a GameCube or Xbox fan).  The gameplay is very good for a survival horror - there is plenty of puzzle solving, adventure, exploration, and combat to keep the interest level up.  That's what I like about survival horror: it's not just about fighting to stay alive, but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances.  And, while Resident Evil 2 isn't anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series, it is still a top-notch game to play for any fan of the genre, and I highly recommend it.  The first one you can play on your own; I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him, and vice versa.  The reason the title of my review is \"I was wrong...\" is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyone's time.  So, I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk. But, there is one issue I just can't stop from addressing: the controversy over the control scheme.  Now, I won't go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody, but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view.  The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way.  This is a genre for puzzle solving, plotlines, exploration, and thought, not just about shooting things.  They made the controls this way to render it, in a way, a sort of \"anti-action\" type of game genre.  Still, though, once you get used to the controls, like me, you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough. Another thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their... \"creative\" death sequences (okay, so maybe they die a second time, but this time for good).  Naturally, you can blow their heads off, but even more possibilities await your execution.  Sometimes, you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets, or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half, the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you.  When you upgrade your shotgun later on, you can actually blow their chest in half!  And, with a rocket launcher, if you fire at them square in their torso, their arms, head, and a good portion of their upper body will be gone.  If you hit them to the right side, most of said side will be gone, as will their head and respective arm, yet their left arm will still be attached.  Pretty cool, huh?  Code: Veronica X didn't have anything like that, which is rather too bad. The only problem I had with this game, and it really isn't a problem with the game itself, is that it really made me shake my head at Code: Veronica X.  It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogame-making abilities.  Heck, even the first Resident Evil is better than REC:VX.  For example, in the first one, the hunters had narrow, sharp, reptilian eyes, rows of razor-sharp teeth that protruded from their mouths, and they looked pretty scary, but in Code: Veronica, they didn't have such teeth (it almost looked like they didn't have any at all), and they also had small, beady eyes, making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy. Yet another good part about this game is the Titan.  I must say, he is really one heck of a bad guy.  But, of course, he's nowhere near as bad*ss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head.  But he's cool nonetheless. So, in conclusion, if you like survival horror games, then I suggest you try this one out.  But don't expect it to be better than Silent Hill, if you're a fan of that series (just as a side note).I was wrong...</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>80000621</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A2582KMXLK2P06</td><td>B00000I1BJ</td><td>Bryan</td><td>Now THIS is how you're supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody, violent game!  Blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies.  It's so strange and relaxing to experience this.  I know you will laugh at what I am about to tell you, but I never bothered with this game when it first came out.  Yeah, I know, I lost many friends because of this.  I ignored this game in 1998, and my level of coolness went right down the tubes.  I had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates again. Children shouldn't play this game.  If you think it's ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person.  Yes that's right: you can walk through a police station in this game.  If in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on (and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again) you now have a place to take out your frustrations- Resident Evil 2. The weapons in this game are realistically cool.  I like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces.  Don't try this at home, but do try this on your Playstation.  The magnum doesn't make much noise so you wouldn't think it'd be such a bad-ass weapon, but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens.  You know you shouldn't do that in real life though, right?  You'd go to jail for a very long time.  And if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies, you'd only get laughed at by the entire court room.  Use your head. If this game doesn't satisfy your sick animal-like needs, then try looking for the fire blaster thing.  You can cook zombies with this.  It's near the end of the game hidden in a locker.  Go near the locker and press the X button, and it will open and you will say \"sweet\". In this game you have two CD's.  One CD is for the Leon adventure, and the other CD is for the Claire adventure.  You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire.  To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire.  I've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast.  I'm sure on normal it's quite harder, maybe so hard you can't think straight and become dumb.  Of course you aren't dumb, it's just that video games can confuse you sometimes. Man I'm tired.  But I'm never too tired to take a couple hours from my easy-going day and blasting my way through this super cool game.  The only downside is that you can't skip the cutscenes.  That's fine at first, when you want to listen closely to the story (even though I didn't) but after a while you really wish Capcom would have put a skip button on this thing. Still, great game.  It's old, but please don't be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old it's not good.  I've been around people who think like that and they just ain't cool.  Sure, these people get all the girls and all the friends, but what else?  What's \"in\" sucks, and what's old is cool.  You think I'm wrong?  Good for you.

I wanted a 6 qt but Amazon forced you to buy Amazon Prime if you wanted the 6 qt and I didn't want that FORCED on me as I don't want Prime Membership right now and didn't want the hassle to quit later. But as it turned out the 4 qt is more than enough for one or two people or even if you have a small child.  It's well and simply made and very cheap compared to others out there.  Was not sure about the crude rocking cap but it works, is reliable and simple to  see if the pressure is correct by it's gentle rocking. One decision to buy this was the gasket and other rubber seals are cheap to replace.  The other one I looked at and really liked, the gasket and rubber replacements would cost me nearly $18 dollars a year to upkeep paying for another of their Pressure Cookers in only 3 YEARS!! The aluminum used is soft and scratches and stains easily and is not hardened i.e anodized.  I wish it was but the cost would go higher too.  But the manual gives a way to remove stains.  Have not tried it as the light stains don't bother me.  I also did NOT detect any aluminum taste with dishes that contain acidic ingredients.  A well-known site tested for aluminum and said it leeches .0025 of aluminum, but said when you take an antacid, one tablet contains 250 mg of aluminum!  Drinking from soda cans can give you 1 or 2 mg of it. If that still bothers you go get a stainless-steel one.  But the shape changes compared to the aluminum one even though they have the same capacity.  I think the SS model is flatter and not as tall. I bought it mostly to cook beans in it and it excels at that.  I tried their bean recipe and it's good as any.  Completely satisfied.  I also use it to cook soups, stews and am still experimenting.  I don't know which is better at the moment for doing the latter as I only had this for a few months.  Whether traditional cooking, i.e. Crockpot (failed at beans unless you buy it canned) or traditional stove, coil or gas. I can't seem to get the full flavor nuances on the latter when using the Pressure Cooker, however, strangely, we did gobble up everything made by it.  Cabbage in soup gets overcooked, though, as this is powerful and and has only one setting at 15 lbs.  Perhaps delicate herbs and flavoring get smothered by the extreme pressure?  Maybe not either, as I'm still experimenting in amounts and may take me a year or more to determine the truth, as I don't use fresh herbs and tend to customize my recipes on the fly. I might add, also, it has a strangely very comfortable handle.

I have handed this book to new sales trainees wanting to know  'how to sell' as it gets across the simple example of 'persistence pays  off'.  It sheds light in the manner that salespeople are really the people  whose task it is to introduce new things into the society, and it is upon  their efforts and results that measure the new technology or products  ultimate success.  No new technology goes anywhere without someone along  the line selling it to someone.  I have long since felt that this simple  tale by Dr. Suess conveyed that lesson with this story about 'Sam I  Am'.

Or  'It's not socially acceptable, I couldn't possibly...'  The resistent man  in this tale finally is made to really see things for himself, and  disregard his previous fixed opinions about things.  Ultimately he is  enlightened upon the glories of Sam's offering of Green Eggs and Ham, and  he finds upon actually trying them that he likes them.  This is a timeless  story that holds an incredible message about observation and on the flip  side, persistence. Look at it this way: had Sam not persisted with his  sales efforts, the man would have been denied the happiness he ultimately  found in trying Green Eggs and Ham.  Also if the man never looked and  finally tried it for himself, he would have missed out on some happiness he  did not know existed, because he was forbidding himself to actually look  and experience it himself and knocking aside all social considerations that  would retrain him. I consider this to be more than just a story spun by  Dr. Suess for entertainment of children, but more exactly a lesson about  life to be understood at all levels of society.

The un-named hero of the story has so many troubles he doesn't know what to do, so, on the advice of a passerby, decides to make the trip to Solla Sollew, where they  never have troubles (at least, very few!) So begins an odyssey which, after  more adventures than you'll find in any other Seuss, teaches the lesson  that it's better to face troubles than to run away.  This book captivated  me on my 5th birthday (the year it was first published) and is still my  favorite. The plot is more complete and complex than any other Seuss, and  the moral is as valuable today as when I first read it.  A side benefit is  the striking use of color; the Dr. used a more subtle color scheme in Solla  Sollew and it enhances the realism of the story.

Unfortunately, after a week in Rome we decided this book was fairly worthless. If it provided deep history on the sites we saw (so we could review what we had seen in the evenings), I'd be thrilled. Unfortunately, the book comes with maps printed so small it's hard to read them even after you've seen the things they portray in person. And the guide has only a tiny amount of history and background on things... mostly it provides inane comments like \"to the left of XYZ, you'll see ABC\" which a guide like the Eyewitness Guide does more clearly with pictures. (Not to mention its descriptions say things like \"from the entrance you can see...\" without acknowledging that there are 6 separate entrances to the site or clarifying which one it's referring to.) It also provides distinctly un-insightful history saying things like \"[name] was the person who gave real meaning to the abbreviation S.P.Q.R\" but without actually telling you what SPQR stands for or how the person gave it meaning. Perhaps the book is a decent refresher for people who already know Rome's history, but don't expect any insight into things you don't already know. And it's definitely not a guide to carry with you--the maps are tiny and illegible with 3-point type, and the information too dense to find things quickly--it's laid out and reads like a 400 page novel.dense and unhelpful for first-time tourists</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>80000662</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A23ONMGKEWDG4M</td><td>B00002N636</td><td>R.

Garrard</td><td>Unlike any of his other books, Dr. Suess's \"The Butter Battle Book\" is as close to an anti-war book as any children's text could be.  It tells of two warring countries divided by a great wall.  The similarity between the East and the West of pre-fall of the Berlin Wall is evident to the plot. The Zooks on one side of the wall eat their bread with the butter side down; the Yooks on the side eat their bread with the butter side up.  This is the reason for the conflict.  Each side feels that theirs is the correct manner for eating bread.  Becoming suspicious of each other, they construct this wall and devise military means to defend themselves from any attack from the other side.  Humorously, the author portrays military strategists as obsessive little men that endlessly work in backrooms creating greater weapons of destruction. The story ends with the two opposing generals facing each other with the ultimate bomb that will destroy the enemy's land.  The grandson of one general asks the question, \"Who's going to drop it?\"  The reply is, \"Be patient...we will see.\" A powerful statement is this for it raises questions about our own relationship in the World Order.  Dr. Suess, known for his whimsical excursion into fantasy and lyrical rhyme, has not abandoned these elements.  He has just expanded his horizons by writing a children's book for adults.  This work should be required reading for military and government leaders worldwide! The theme of acceptance of differences is the key to this story.

The Republican Spanish government, supported by Russian communists, socialists, American mercenaries, and other foreigners including Hemingway, was fighting nationalist rebels led by General Francisco Franco, who was backed by German Nazis and Italian fascists.  Stalin saw the war as an opportunity to gain another foothold for Russian communism in western Europe and to divert world attention away from the purges occurring in his own country.  Hitler and Mussolini wanted a Chance to test their new war machine.  Hemingway, although not a communist, believed in the Spanish Republican cause.  The war became a dress rehearsal for World War  II.  .  The story is about a band of Republican guerrillas operating behind fascist lines. Their mission  is to blow up a bridge to slow the fascist advance.  Over the course of a few days the members of the group developed friendships, love relationships,and suspicions of each other.  They accomplish their mission , but at a high price.  The main character is wounded, and at his own request is left behind to try to slow the progress  of the enemy so the others can escape.  This is where the story ends.  I was hoping for a more final ending, but over all I was happy with the book.  I had heard of the Spanish Civil War, but like most people I  knew little of the details of the event.  By reading this story I gained much insight into the causes and effects of the war as well as some understanding of Hemingway's attitude toward communism, socialism, and fascism.

There must be, for me, some connection with the subject matter, and there must a real interest in understanding what the author is trying to say.  Of course, that begs the problem of each (writer and reader) being able to discuss the book either with the author or another reader. I liked the book because of the honesty of O'Neill, and I have several qualifications. First, it was interesting because it explains, in detail, what was/is involved in becoming a Navy Seal; second, the story was told (1st Person) through the eyes (memories and judgment) of one individual (a personal narrative). Qualifications: Robert O'Neill went through several real and important transitions that I related to.  One was his relationships with his fellow Seals and, especially, those who were on his various teams.  These relationships were very strong; they were a transition from a  narrow, personal concern for becoming a Seal to creating a family unit on which military combat relies.  When O'Neill began to change, mature past his Seal experiences, he was finding that many of his Seal brothers were becoming envious of his notoriety  and, therefore, a lack of connection which had been some vital was experienced. Another important relationship was with his wife and children.  This was mentioned in very minimal terms which is somewhat understandable because of the lack of time spent with them.  As his story developed, they became more significant, but it left me wondering about his wife's perception and feelings.  I thought that this deserved more attention because of its importance. The last chapter (23) is quite an ending, and yet it is a beginning for O'Neill.  His view of his life and that The Seal Bubble as over is important.  That statement explains his view of the changes he experienced, of transition from one life-stage to another.  Life-stages are often age/maturity related in combination with changes in activity.  It is a growth and adaptive process which can be difficult.  He recognizes that he is in transition and that he believes his Seal experiences and his processing of those experiences has prepared him for a new stage.  This chapter should be a new book.

The good: - This thing moves air. I set it up as an exhaust fan on one side of my 700 sq ft house, and open a window on the other. Instantly doors swing open (or shut) blinds start waving in the wind. I suppose one couldn't expect more air movement for it's size and cost. - The \"storm guard\" feature is really nice. I like being able to leave it installed and still shut the window when needed. - As it is \"mounted\" in a window, the fan really needs to be reversible, and this one is. The bad: - After a few months it developed a terribly obnoxious rattle. At first I assume a loose screw/washer that I could tighten down. I disassembled the fan and simply can't find the culprit so I now suspect a bad bearing someplace. When it is in it's \"rattle mood\" it rattles regardless of speed or direction. It rattles maybe 25% the time. When not rattling it is quiet enough on low speed to sleep near, but when rattling, I can't stand to be in the same room. Like fingernails on a chalkboard (for those who remember chalk boards :) The ugly: - It is large. I mean really big. But I'll cut it slack on this one, as it needs to be big. - The worst problem here is the color. It's a nicotine stained institutional off-white. It couldn't be uglier. With it's massive size and ugly color. Well, you get the point. Overall, I could live with it's ugliness, but the rattling noise kills any love i may have for it.

About 90% of the plot is delivered via conversations between the characters in a sort of proletariat narrative style that I found tiresome after only a few pages. I confess that I must lack the elevated culture needed to appreciate the rich imagery and gripping themes of such a complicated novel. It might have been easier if I didn't have to wade through the \"thee\" and \"thine\" and if Hemingway had just told the story instead of writing 480 pages of forced dialogue. To me it was an over-complicated story about a communist college professor who leaves America to go fight in a communist rebellion in Spain during which he is ordered to blow up a bridge. Along the way he seduces some local teenage girl, who is desperate to feel loved after being raped and abused. We'd definitely call it pedophilia today, due to their age differences. He also reminisces about living it up and rubbing elbows with the communist leaders in a posh hotel they've commandeered. He listens to some stories about the heinous atrocities and war crimes the communists commit in the outset of the uprising. It guess it's supposed to be about the characters, not what happens, but I couldn't care less...it was boring as hell and I wish I had my money and time back.I must be a cretin...</td><td>4</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>80000756</td><td>1.0</td><td>false</td><td>A1BGVNVTF0YQ3</td><td>0002051850</td><td>marvin watkins</td><td>I can't believe Uncle Ernie won the Nobel.

This game offers more than one dozen pod racers and drivers, each is unique with unique speeds, skills, traction breaks and so on, each pod racer must be earned though by coming in first for the race where the pod racer is featured. Along the way you pick up \"cash\" from bets that you come in first, second or third, then you use this cash to buy better parts to your pod racer and pit droids to quickly repair your racer. This is a highly imaginative game complete with three major circuits and a special circuit, in terms of the courses themselves I am a fan of racing games and nothing has ever gotten this amazing, jumps that will take your breath away, ice caverns that try to trick you, anti gravity tubes that will let you fly, swamps that will boggle your mind and speeds to boggle your mind too.

I thought this might be a good introduction to Hemingway - a good adventure story with lots of action and heroism - a story i could enjoy in case I did not like the prose. Well, prepare to be delighted. The book contains all the things in the headline of this review and is absolutely not an action adventure story. It is a \"true\" story about the nature of war and how people affect it and are affected by it. What Mr Hemingway taught me is that he is a writer foremost and everything else after. He reminds us that he has been in actual war and that it affects very normal everyday people in generally awful ways. For them (us) there is no happy ending. If, like me, you have put off reading Hemingway because his novels were set decades ago, please put aside your apprehension and pick up this (or any other) book by him.Tenderness, love, betrayal, brutality, cowardice, redemption, heroism, death, beauty, ugliness, duty</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>80000766</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A2AVJH0HHKRX0K</td><td>B00000J2W7</td><td>R.

The Sun Also Rises really moved me. I once asked a girl in a bar what her favorite last line of any novel was, and she said \"Isn't it pretty to think so\" which is exactly what I was thinking, so I about fell out of my chair. This book is very unusual. I can't say I enjoyed it all that much, but I certainly am thinking about it. Written as if it has been translated directly from Spanish to English, with expletives bleeped out via the word unprintable or obscenity, and conversations that go on and on and on about nothing (kind of like they do in real life). And all of it leads up to something we all know is going to happen... the bell's gonna toll, and it's gonna toll for thee. And when it does, the horror of war and the stupidity of human kind and the ridiculous game of life kind of rears up and slaps you in the face. There are some moments in here too, that just hurt to read, painful to read. Robert Jordan talking of his father's suicide and his lack of respect for his father. As a father myself, and of course knowing Hemingway's life struggles, this just burned to read. And old Anselmo, honorable Anselmo who will kill if he must, but will never enjoy it, never want it, his poor life. A part of me knows - even if it isn't true - that all these people in this book were real. Maybe amalgamations, maybe direct to page, and even if not, it doesn't matter, they are all real. And Pablo drinks wine, bowl after bowl, and it seems like the only answer. And maybe it was. So why do people still talk about Hemingway... why is that word \"hemingway\" one that everyone knows... I think this book must be a big part of it. I haven't hit wikipedia yet, I don't want my thoughts tainted, but this novel strikes me as ahead of its time even now somehow. And like I said, I didn't really enjoy it. And honestly, this is my second stab at it. Got halfway through about ten years ago. But I get it. I get what the big deal is. And it is a big deal.

This may be to get the info to the reader and then jump in the head of the character, but it's confusing. The repetition is over the top. Again, it often shows the obsession of thought of a character, but it makes me want to jump to the next paragraph. Don't think I missed anything when I did that.

Super Smash Bros reinvented the rules of fighting games, combining platforming with fighting moves, such as punching, kicking, etc. What's even more of a no-brainer is how several Nintendo franchises crossed over to star in this one game. Each character has their own abilities, such as Mario throwing fireballs, and Fox using his laser gun. There are a variety of stages to choose from, and most of them have their own gimmicks. The Mushroom Kingdom (unlcokable) has pipes you can go into, and Pokemon Stadium lets you open a door that certain Pokemon pop out of and attack. The 1-Player Mode is a series of battles, like how fighting games usually are. Unfortunately, the rosters of the battles don't change.

Also, the rubber part will smell like whatever you cooked.  Lastly, it can be unsafe.  My first one had hot water shoot out of it like a water fall when I released the pressure.  The main way to avoid this is to not put too much liquid the pot.  Most things make their own liquid anyway, like frozen veggies.  Also, take it off the stove and lower the pressure one step at a time.  For example go from setting 2 to setting 1 then release steam.  All in all, i like it.

Amazon says nothing about cooking on a glass top, instruction Book says not to use on glass top stoves because the bottom has a concave in the middle that won't allow it to get up to pressure, Well I have a glass top and not wanting to send it back I tried it, came to a boil faster than a old (20 or more years)I own, Put the lid on and it locked fairly quick, maybe 5 minutes? steam started coming out of the top, I waited about 2 minutes and put the weight on, maybe 6 to 8 minutes it was bounceing like it should, so much for not coming up to pressure on a glass top stove. The finish is super polished, Looks like stainless steel not aluminum. add photo does not do it justice. After the test and using it once I found another DO NOT USE ON GLASS TOP, so I sent a E mail to consumeraffairs@wearever.com today here is what I asked model 92160 6 quart cooker Bought it on line at Amazon.com the descripttion on their web site didn't say any thing about a glass top stove. in the instructions saw that it might not come up to pressure on a glass top which I have, I tested it with just water to see and it came up to pressure really fast, twice as fast as my old mirror 4 quart flat bottom pressure cooker I have. so I cooked a resipe of rice pudding in the book and it did what it was suppossed to do, came up to pressure fast and cooked just like the book instructions time setting. Then I was rereading the instruction book some more and I came accross this Got it and in the  page 2 of instructions and it says do not use on flat  glass top or glass ceramic ranges could damage cooker, this cooker has a curved concave bottom which will not make proper contact with the cooking surface which could result in damage to your pressure cooker.  what do they mean damage, is it going to blow up or what. I can't understand why it would be any diffront than a  electric coil wire stove top, it wouldn't contact the bottom any more than My glass top,  in fact less ,,according to you to get proper contact you would have to use a gas stove only. Is it safe to use on my glass top?  2-19-09 well its 5 years later and still hasn't blown up, use it every few months cooking beans mostly6 Quart pressure cooker mirror aluminum</td><td>5</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>80000808</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>AGH22LH74Z4OE</td><td>B00000J97G</td><td>david laselva</td><td>greatFive Stars</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>80000809</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A275I6LGA626A7</td><td>B00002N602</td><td>vickieg</td><td>As I grew up my mother used pressure cookers and pressure canners almost everyday for something.  In the past few years I am always looking for time saving things for the kitchen.  There are many foods that my family and I like that require a lot of cooking time.  The pressure cooker has been great for cooking dried beans, fresh green beans, vegetables like carrots, beets, etc. for making bisque, the list goes on.  This cooker has made the weekdays easier for me. I'm gone from 6:15am to 4:15pm every weekday not leaving a lot of time for preparing meals. This pressure cooker does not have a gauge and the weight is not marked 5, 10, 15 as I remember pressure cookers having.  It has an instruction booklet with it.  It contains suggested cooking time.  It does have a gasket.  It is always a good idea to check and make sure it is in place before cooking.  It has a safety release rubber valve that will blow out should it gain too much pressure.  It also has a release valve at the handle that drops so that you know it is safe to remove the weight on top. I did actually can some pints of salsa with it.  It will hold three pints without one touching the other.  I did not try any quarts in it. When it first came I didn't take it out of the box for over a month.  Sad I let it go to waste that long.  I've used it at least a couple times a week since opening it though.  I have had no problems with it what so ever.  It is a good all around cooker. My next pressure cooker will have the marked pressure weight and/or gauge. I want one large enough to hold a few jars for small canning jobs. The more that I buy online the more that I count on reviews.  I am not in any way affiliated with this company or seller.

Besides the main feature of processing 32,000 colors with specially designed games, the GBC is backwards compatible with classic monochrome Game Boy titles, though you can play with different palettes by tinkering with the face buttons when the title screen appears.  Also, though the system's slimmed-down design is pretty convenient for pocket games, it's a bit too narrow for big hands.  It offers no shortage in battery power, and the AC outlet at the bottom provides extended play with the right adapter.  The biggest oddity on the handheld (for me) is that you raise the volume by turning the switch down instead of up.  As for the GBC's less-than-stellar resolution, after discovering the Japanese-exclusive Game Boy Light, there's no excuse for having to find a proper light source.

There is no comparison to any other portable system. I've had Game Boy since I was a child of 7. I had the old gray bulky one. I loved that one. That means that the Game Boy Color was even better! I love the fact that it's backwards portable. You can still insert regular Game Boy cartridges in it, like Tetris, Super Mario Land, or Pokemon Red. Game Boy is a very stable system. It rarely disfunctions. One problem is that when you turn on the Game Boy sometimes the Nintendo sign is messed up. Blowing into the game cartridge doesn't help. You need to re-insert the game cartridge, realligning it correctly. You could blow though, for good luck. Game Boy Color's portability alone is a great plus. It fits in your pocket! The games are extensive, with so many titles spanning a decade. I think it's the best system.

Other than that, this console has improved on its graphics! On games like Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Pokemon Gold and Silver, the graphics are much better! Also, there is a ample amount of color that your eyes can feast on. Now if you have game boy Pocket and Regular game boy and you're playing Pokemon [It doesn't matter which one], you will notice that when you walk around in Pocket, It's very blurry. Well this fault has ben fixed in GameBoy Color. It's extremely helpful because it enables you to see more detail and little things that you couldn't see before. I also have some regular gameboy games that aren't for game boy color and if you play them on GameBoy color, they show little color, but no blurryness. Now make sure you read what the box says when you are buying a gameboy color game. There are two types, there is one that says FOR GAMEBOY COLOR ONLY, which you can't use on the other gameboys. The second type just says that it's for gameboy color. Those you can play on the regular gameboys. It won't show any color but at least you can play it. There are a couple faults for the gameboy color. One of which is that the console is too small [for me I have big fingers so it's hard for a grown up kid]. A second fault is that the batterys run out faster than the Original GameBoy [The gameboy pocket battery use is outrageous! I played the gameboy pocket for 2 hours straight and the batterys were already starting to run out.]. The original gameboy lasted me up to 23 hours! This only lastes me for about 12. Well I can see why because of all the good color and good graphics. So my point is that this color gameboy, teal, is a good color to get [if you like it]. The console is worth the money too.

Tucker</td><td>Alpha 3 is the culmination of everything Capcom had worked towards with their fighting games. Everyone knows Capcom has the habit of sticking to similar concepts for several games in a row (Mega Man, Resident Evil, etc), but in no other case has the last game in a series before a major change been so fulfilling. Street Fighter Alpha 3 is (in my opinion) the best Street Fighter game available (including the recently-released SF2 HD Remix). The gameplay is a blend of the slow-paced and strategic Street Fighter 2 and the more varied and frenetic Alpha series. Air combos, alpha counters, and flashy finishing moves combine with superior character balancing and deep fighting strategy. The main \"arcade\" experience can be brutally hard, as it would be in the wishes of any Street Fighter fan. The two-player experience is also extremely fun, as players new to the Alpha series can choose different fighting modes, one of which (X-ism) is more aligned with classic SF2 balancing. Other modes include A-ism, the Alpha standard, and V-ism, a mode that enhances a player's ability to chain standard and special moves together for lethal damage. Alpha 3 introduced an incredible World Tour mode, enabling players to tour the world (if you will) fighting various characters under various conditions. These tasks may be as simple as defeating an opponent to as complex as defeating three opponents with only super combo moves whilst your character is low on health. Completing these objectives unlock abilities that can be linked to your character, such as automatic blocking, taking zero damage while blocking, infinite guard, and more. On top of that, characters built up during World Tour mode are playable in other many of the other modes. The other gameplay modes include training, boss battle, survival, and more. Two-player battles can also accommodate multiple player characters, in both versus and cooperative (ie P1 and P2 vs C1 and C2, or P1 and P1 vs P2 and P2). Two-player back in the days of SSF2:Turbo was the only way to play, but Alpha 3 dramatically increased the available options for single players. These lend towards the game's long life, as one player can play in various modes ranging from standard arcade style to fighting bosses to survival mode and more. In essence, Street Fighter Alpha 3 defines fighting games of the Playstation era. It is a smooth balance of speed and strategy. Though the graphics are dated by today's standards, two-dimensional games tend to age gracefully, and this game is no exception. Street Fighter fans owe it to themselves to own a copy of Alpha 3, if not to check a popular franchise's history, then to own the best Street Fighter game ever made.The Ultimate Street Fighter game</td><td>3</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>80000832</td><td>4.0</td><td>true</td><td>A24KR6ZT4DNKU1</td><td>B00002N602</td><td>Charles Shields</td><td>Does a good job of cooking meats fast.

Before I began reading this book I had heard and read from many that the book was a classic and a very good read; after finishing the book I have to say that I completely agree. This book well deserves the praise that it has been given over the years; it is a classic in every sense of the word.  From Hemingway's unmatched descriptions of the beautiful Spanish countryside to the deep inner thoughts and struggles of the people. Hemingway has captured the true inner feelings of the Spanish people in their struggle for their idea of freedom, from the gripping oppression of fascism.  Yet he goes even further, in the unlikely relationship that develops between Robert Jordan and recently rescued Maria. He is still able to show that there is always some good even in some of the darkest situations. From betrayals and tragedy to unlikely and unexpected aid Hemingway covers all spectrums and interests The only criticism I can give this book is concerning the ending which I personally found unsatisfying but that is for you to decide for yourself.

He is sent into the mountains to make contact with a small band of guerillas to blow a bridge in support of an offensive. Hemingway's tremendous strength of drawing characters that the reader comes to know and care about is on full display in \"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\"  Jordan falls in love with the young woman, Maria, who is seeking refuge from a world that has robbed her of her childhood innocence.  There is Pablo, the former leader who has seen the futility of the war and cannot face the day without dulling his mind with wine.  There is Pilar, Pablo's mate, who longs for her youth, but has now assumed the role of leader and mother to the small group of fighters. Robert Jordan and the reader come to know the dynamics of the group quite well.  Jordan wrestles with the necessity of endangering the group of people for \"the cause.\"  This book depicts the contrast of war's brutality with the camaraderie of friends. \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is considered a classic for a reason.

Myst is one of them. I remember playing this game back in 1993 and getting my but whipped with the puzzles. I recently replayed it and found myself in awe of how well constructed it is. Of course, graphics have advanced since 1993, but Myst shows game developers how puzzles should really work. Unlike too many games today, Myst brilliantly evokes a sense of wonder and mystery. When you start the game, you're just thrown into a new world with no explanation. You are left to explore and discover. There is a story with shocking twists, but the story depends upon your involvement and choices, not simply handed to you. The puzzles require a lot of time and thought. If you don't like puzzles and thinking, don't play this game. If you like challenges, Myst will challenge you. The puzzles often require you to make connections between separate pieces of information or view your environment in a new way. Some are frustrating and I did need to look at a hint guide a few times (particularly for the Mechanical Age elevator) but they all do have a logic. Unlike other reviewers, I found the one area Myst doesn't hold up well is in building an immersive environment. Myst as a world doesn't have a logic. There's a spaceship, a boat, a clock tower, etc., just sitting on the island. It seems more like a video game hub than an actual world. I think Myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the world. Overall, Myst was a historic computer game back in 1993 and is still worth playing 20 years later. From the early 1990s, I personally preferred Presto Studios' Journeyman Project, which also had a compelling point-and-click adventure and featured pre-rendered 3D environments. However, until that game gets rereleased, Myst is easily the best point-and-click adventure readily out there.

To be honest, I chose this one because I was familiar with the Metallica song that was named after this book. I found this to be one of the most difficult books I have ever read; not because of the style or because I didn't like it but because simply it was just a difficult story to read. The novel is full of strong themes about death and honor. Robert Jordan, the main character, is a man who does not get caught up in any causes or seems to hold any passionate views. Through the whole book he questions his beliefs in the socialist cause; his only concern seems to be defeating the fascists. All of this changes when he meets Maria. The two fall for each other immediately and suddenly Jordan is confronted with the real prospect of the fact that he will not survive his mission. What made this story so difficult to read was that Hemmingway comes across as a nihilist in the writing of this story. His characters are completely controlled by fate and feel powerless to stop the events that are put into place. It seems as if Jordan would have been better off had he not met Maria and cared about her. Overall, the story is very good.

However, Hemingway's English translations were so irritating, trite, and immature that I could not get past them.  The use of \"thy\" and \"thou\" to indicate the ud. form is ridiculous in 20th century English.  Quoting the characters as asking, \"How do you call yourself?\" instead of \"What is your name?\" is downright silly.  If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally, he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index.  Regardless, who needs a literal translation?  How is \"How do you call yourself\" better than \"What is your name\"?  And is it really important to know who uses ud. to whom when this form doesn't even exist in modern English?  I found these \"translations\" so distracting from what was going on that I couldn't continue past chapter 2.

And yet in the end, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is ultimately a novel with a fatalistic outlook and few, if any, redeeming messages for humanity, in spite of all the commentaries it makes about human nature. To me, the story was the most interesting as a reflection of Hemingway's own experiences and strange outlooks on life. For example, one would assume that Robert Jordan, the main character, is a reflection of what Hemingway deems heroic. Like Hemingway, Jordan is a rugged, somewhat independent sort. Jordan characterizes the literary period's allure for the expatriate life and Hemingway's fascination with Spain and dislike for the Spanish Fascist. But yet, one has to wonder what compels Jordan, an American college professor from Montana, to be involved in this Spanish Civil War to the extent that he has become a demolitions expert and is ready to kill Spaniards (regardless of what side they happen to have fallen upon) without any conscience. What busness, really and truly, is this war of his? Further, how do you root for a hero, who is fighting for, and willing to give his life while following orders from, Communists that Hemingway makes clear are every bit as brutal as the Fascists? Notable is the fact that the Jordan character feels shame for a father who committed suicide, just as Hemingway's own father did. And for Hemingway to commit suicide 20 years after this book was written parallels the sense of inevitable doom that is a pervasive theme of this story. This book demonstrates that Hemingway had a way with descriptions and dialogue that can be at times entertaining and at other times irritating. For example, his conventions for speech that is a more literal reflection of the Spanish language is rather clever. However, as the story progresses, Hemingway's usage of the King James-style \"Thee\" and \"Thou\" to indicate that a more formal Spanish dialect is being used becomes distractingly gimmicky and wore quite thin by the end of the book. At least, it did for me. This is a story about people who are flawed to the extent that they will kill without hesitation...people who have abandoned God and Godly virtues, and look to themselves for their own salvation. What little is left is a cause whose means and ends don't seem to differ from the alternative, and an appeal to virtues of loyalty to the band, or one's responsibility to follow his duty. The trouble is, these appeals are made among characters who Jordan - as Hemingway's voice - often considers untrustworthy, repugnant and treacherous. Rather contradictory, I would say. And Jordan's fatalistic sense of duty to a cause of questionable politics and in a country that isn't even his own is just plain strange to say the least. Interesting as character study, and a microcosm of the Spanish Civil War, but very depressing.Descriptive but depressing</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>80000873</td><td>4.0</td><td>false</td><td>AGEIT17HENDIS</td><td>0002051850</td><td>Alfred Johnson</td><td>I have been interested, as a pro-Republican partisan, in the Spanish Civil War since I was a teenager.  What initially perked my interest, and remains of interest, is the passionate struggle of the Spanish working class to create its own political organization of society, its leadership of the struggle against Spanish Fascism and the romance surrounding the entry of the International Brigades, particularly the American Abraham Lincoln Battalion of the 15th Brigade, into the struggle. Underlying my interests has always been a nagging question of how that struggle could have been won by the working class. The Spanish proletariat certainly was capable of both heroic action and the ability to create organizations that reflected its own class interests i.e. the worker militias and factory committees. Of all modern working class uprisings after the Russian revolution Spain showed the most promise of success. Russian Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky noted in one of his writings on Spain that the Spanish proletariat at the start of its revolutionary period had a higher political consciousness than the Russian proletariat in 1917. That analysis calls into question the strategies put forth by the parties of the Popular Front, including the Spanish Communist Party- defeat Franco first, and then make the social transformation of society. Ernest Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bells Toll weighs in on that question. Whatever value the novel had or has as a narrative of a small slice of the Spanish events one must look elsewhere to discovery the causes of the Republican defeat. Ernest Hemingway most definitively was in love with Spain and always lurking just below the surface was his love affair with death. That combination placed in the context of the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39 makes for an explosive, dramatic tale. The hero is an American, Robert Jordan, aka Ernest Hemingway, of fizzy politics but a desire to help the Spanish people. Additionally Jordan, if expediency demands it, is willing to face danger and death at the command of the Communist-dominated International Brigades (although it is not always clear whether he is a Lincoln Brigade volunteer or a freelancer). Hemingway's critique of the Stalinist domination of the military command and therefore authors of the military strategy that led to defeat at times overwhelms the story. His skewering of Andre Marty, leader of the International Brigades, also has that same effect. In short, Hemingway believed that 'outside forces' meddling in Spanish affairs led to death for Jordan and disaster for the Spanish people. Well, nobody expects nor is it mandatory for a novelist to be politically astute or correct. Here Hemingway joins the crowd The one subject that Ernest Hemingway seemed consistently to excel at was the telling of war stories. And whatever else might be true of For Whom the Bell Tolls it is preeminently a war story. A classic war romance if you have also seen the movie treatment of the book starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. It might be a male thing, it might be a Hemingway thing, or it might be that the nature of war lends itself to dramatic tension that holds a story together. Today, in some literary circles, it is not considered politically correct to laud works by such dead, white males as Hemingway but the flat out truth is that the man could write. If his work stands outside the current canon of American literary efforts then something is wrong with the new canon. To make matters worst the current leftist-oriented literary establishment, grizzled, hard-bitten battle-tested warriors that they are, has not been the only force that has taken aim at Hemingway's head. At the time of publication in 1940 the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion, those who actually fought in Spain and the various Communist Parties throughout the world were unhappy with the novel. Why? Hemingway was too harsh on the deficiencies of the Communists, the International Brigades and the Republican forces in general. Above I mentioned that writers were not expected to be politically astute. That is one thing. But to say that Hemingway was essentially sabotaging the exiled Republican efforts to aid the refugees by the thrust of his novel is also politically wrong. The man did materially and militarily aid the Republican side (financially sponsoring volunteers and ambulances, as well as reportage). That accrues to his honor. In short, Hemingway's writings-yes.

Like all great literary works, it transcends the era in which it was written and speaks to readers for generations after the author has passed away.  This is a great novel by a great writer, and I can't understand how anyone would rate this less than five stars.  The novel spans only a few days, and contains the story of Robert Jordan, a volunteer in Spain who is sent on mission to blow up a key bridge with a band of guerillas behind the Nationalist lines as part of a Republican offensive.  The novel is primarily a dialogue between Jordan and the members of the guerilla band.  The tension builds to the final confrontation at the bridge.  There are several extensive sidebars not directly relevant to the main plot, including the discussion of the fate of Pilar's village, and the last stand of El Sordo's guerilla band.  These are probably the best written, most detailed, sections of the novel.  Some would say that these distract from the main story, but I argue that they add richness and depth to the characters and to the events of the main plot. EH writes with a direct, readable prose.  His characters are complex and multi-dimensional, and often conflicted.  One may argue as to whether this is his best work or not, or whether he was a better writer of short stories or novels.  What does it matter?  This is one of the greatest war novels, indeed one of the greatest novels, ever written.  In terms of richness and depth, only Zola's La Debacle is comparable to this work. One thing in particular struck me about this story that make it an unconventional war novel.  Most war novels either take the philosophic position of patriotic glory for the homeland or war as a pointless exercise in destruction.  Robert Jordan has a unique perspective in this book in that he is an outsider fighting for a cause, not for a country or a government.  He isn't driven by patriotism, or love of country.  He isn't fighting for the national army of his homeland.  This gives him a unique perspective to question why he is fighting and what he is fighting for, particularly after he falls in love.Love, duty, courage, and sacrifice</td><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>80000875</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A2IOKA7AQYLLZU</td><td>B00000JL6V</td><td>A.

Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses.

I don't remember what games I checked out (FFIX?), but Ape Escape was the one title we played together until we had to return it. Her following birthday, I bought it for her. You may think, \"Oh, that's nice,\" but I bought it because I actually wanted to play it... It was the first game I've ever completed in its entirety, and I go back from time to time to replay it, no matter how many times I've caught the monkeys. The sequels are good, but this stands out as the first game to fully require the DualShock controller, and the music in this installment is my favorite in the series. Monkeys have taken over different periods of history, and so it's your job to catch them all and bring down the leader. You get helpful gadgetry along the way, and they're all extremely useful and you'll find yourself using them all to the very end. Sometimes some games give you arsenals that become obsolete a few levels later; not here. Every level can use all your tools. The boss fights are sparse, but the final boss more than makes up for it. It remains one of my most favorite boss battles, though, by today's standards, it's pretty easy. I write this review only a couple weeks after my latest playthrough, and the game still holds up extremely well. I thought that, with my years of gaming experience, catching the monkeys would be a lot easier. While I know most of the game's secrets, and the easier levels were far easier than before, the monkeys still prove a challenge to capture. The patterns for boss fights are easy to get down, and I experienced no degradation in my original copy of the game when playing on a PS3. This game should be a requirement for all PlayStation owners.One of the best platforms on any system.</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>80000887</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A33R4E8T9KVLOM</td><td>0002051850</td><td>Drew Hunkins</td><td>Robert Jordan is one of the most exciting, interesting and principled fictional characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about.  Set during the fascist take over in 1930s Spain, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel that will easily stand the test of time (not much of a prediction since it was written in 1940) and is one of the finest books in the English language.  Jordan, an American, is the main character who comes to Europe to fight the good fight against Franco's military thugs.  The reader is given a fascinating in-depth look into his psyche, where he reflects on his fellow soldiers, plans for warmaking and the justifications and rationalizations along the war trail. Pablo's another character who is burned into your consciousness long after you've finished reading.  A fellow rebel (they weren't rebels in the true sense, since they were fighting for a government they had duly elected; however, they have all the characteristics of guerrillas in that the Spanish military waged an immediate and violent war against that very democratically elected government), the reader is left wondering just how committed he is to the cause.  There is an incredible flashback story detailing Pablo's orchestration of the sadistic torture and humiliation of a group of wealthy fascist sympathizers.  The vivid description involved in this passage is nothing short of extraordinary. Of course the true democrats, fighting for the Republic against the well financed and better armed fascist military, eventually lose the war, but having that foreknowledge does nothing to detract from the cliff-hanger like feelings brought about by the various battles and journeys the rebel crew embarks on. This is the best, and most accessible of all of Hemingway's works.  If someone is interested in reading Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls is the perfect starting point.  As for Hemingway's style of prose, what more can be said, except that it's brilliant, enthralling and readily accessible to the common reader, unlike Joyce and Faulkner.  In my opinion, every American should give some time to Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Commitment, intelligence, sacrifice and fighting for the well being of your fellow man is all there along with a terrific love story. Given that the average American attention span is like a ferret on a double espresso (Dennis Miller), very few will give books like For Whom the Bell Tolls a try with the mass of pop TV garbage out there. An excellent companion to the book is the documentary film \"The Good Fight\" narrated by Studs Terkel.  It gives a mini history lesson of the Spanish Civil War and specifically focuses on a group of U.S. citizens (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) who heroically went abroad and fought along side the democrats against Franco and his fascist military thugs.Wish I could give it 6 stars</td><td>2</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>80000888</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A8N2AQK5WV2LY</td><td>B00000JNHJ</td><td>DashVegeta24</td><td>This is a great game!

Hemingway was very good; sycophants made him sublime. To criticize this work and not rhapsodize over its poetic beauty and its insightful symbolism would seem to be almost in bad taste. But I will do so anyway. Overall I would have to say that the story is good but not great: Robert Jordan is an American fighting for the communists in the Spanish civil war. He is an instructor in Spanish at a Montana college who has taken a sabbatical  to secretly come to Spain. He wants to fight to liberate the workingman. Jordan is sent by his Russian controller to join  a band of guerrillas behind Fascist lines. His mission is to blow up a bridge; this is timed to precisely coincide with a Republican (communist) offensive. Anselmo, an old man who is the most reliable guerilla, takes him to the band of rebels. The band is led by Pablo, an uncouth peasant who has gone from fervent murderous radical to a man who only wants to survive. Pilar, Pablo's woman, is the unifying force in Pablo's band. There are assorted other rebels and Maria, a refugee who has been raped by the fascists. Maria and Robert Jordan fall in love immediately and are soon fornicating like rabbits. The bridge is attacked and destroyed but this leads to the death of Anselmo and to Robert Jordan being mortally wounded. He orders Maria to go on without him and he bids her to escape and enjoy life; thereby he will live through her. The book does give a good picture of the issues of the Spanish civil war. The fascists are portrayed as decent people backed by Nazis and Italian fascists. The Republicans are controlled by Russians, as are puppets on a string. Hemingway makes a point to say that the top Republicans all speak Russian, having been trained as revolutionaries in the Soviet Union. The individual peasants Jordan fights with  are mostly portrayed as decent people with a few savages thrown in for good measure. I had several problems with the book. I understand that Hemingway uses the archaic thee and thou to indicate that the dialogue is being spoken in Spanish. He omits this when Jordan is speaking in English or thinking to himself. This takes some getting used to but is tolerable. It is the awkward translation of Spanish obscene phrases that is done in a silly and annoying way. The phrase \"I obscenity in the milk of your father\" appears dozens of times.  No one speaks this way. It is patently unnatural and just about ruined the book for me. I understand that this is a literal translation of the Spanish oath \"me cago en la leche...\" I understand and don't care. It would have been better to leave the obscenity implied but unsaid without resorting to this awkward device. There is a painfully awkward page where Robert Jordan discovers that Pablo has stolen his detonators. On page 368 he says  \"Oh muck my grandfather and muck this whole treacherous mucking country and every mucking Spaniard in it on either side and to hell forever\" and so forth ( in lieu of the word that is an acronym for \"for unlawful carnal knowledge\") about two dozen times. I understand that in 1940 that word could not appear in print but did it have to be replaced by something so witless. Funny how that word still can't appear in Amazon.com book reviews in 2002. There is another especially awkward scene that sticks in my mind. Hemingway describes Robert Jordan's feelings at having reached orgasm with Maria on page 379: \"Oh now, now, now, the only now, and above all now  and there is no other now but thou now and now is thy prophet. Now and forever now. Come now, now, for there is no now but now. Yes, now. \" and so on for half a page. Give me a break! There is also the problem of some of the poorly drawn and unbelievable characters. Robert Jordan is too perfect to be true (is he Jesus in disguise?). He goes from a mild mannered rural college instructor to a stone killer and demolitions expert in a matter of months. He doesn't have any personal stake in the Spanish conflict but quickly becomes a cool yet eager killer in the service of the Soviet side. His inner dialogue tells us that this is because he has always wanted to do something for downtrodden workers of the world. It is also in part to prove that he is as much a man as his (U.S.) Civil war hero grandfather. The relationship with Maria is unbelievable to the point of being absurd. Jordan is a thirty-something who has never been in love. He and Maria, who is 19,  fall in love at first sight. They immediately decide to have sex ; they plan to get married and live together happily ever after. He is fully aware that he has been handed a suicide mission and is completely unconcerned. How did he live for this long if his own safety is of no interest to him? Much has been made of the fact that this book illustrated the concepts in the Donne poem No Man is an Iland. Well then why do we need nearly five hundred pages of this book when that poem says it so well in a few lines.A very good but flawed classic</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>80000890</td><td>5.0</td><td>false</td><td>A2TZAMKPFXIZUN</td><td>0002051850</td><td>L. P. D. Heinen</td><td>This book is about an American, Robert Jordan, who joins the Republican Army (communists) to fight the nationalists during the civil war in Spain in the 1930's. He joins a guerilla-group which is given the mission to blow up a bridge to obstruct the fascists' offensive. Although he has a bad feeling about the whole situation he persists. I found the character pilar the most interesting, fulfilling a key role of telling the background story (her experience in the war sofar) as well as being the one who keeps the whole group together (her insights give the American, Robert Jordan, some information about Pablo, the member of the group who can't be trusted). Although it has bothered a lot of people (read the other reviews), for me the translated Spanish words and little sentences really added something to the atmosphere of the book as well as to a better depiction of the characters.A Hemingway-fan should love it</td><td>7</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>80000891</td><td>4.0</td><td>false</td><td>A151XCH6MEQC23</td><td>0002051850</td><td>Dawn L Steadman</td><td>\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" is no disappointment to a fan of Hemingway's terse, truthful prose.  Here he employs it to explain the events of a few days during the Spanish Civil War.  The plot is simple: an American fighting for the republic joins a small guerrilla unit in the hills, under orders to blow up a bridge at the beginning of a great assault on the fascists.  The American also falls in love with a young Spanish girl, thus allowing Hemingway to explore his favorite combination of themes, love and war. Hemingway is, in my view, one of the most moving and profound writers of all time.  In this novel, he aptly captures the emotions and motives of those who risk their lives at war, and along the way, offers some extraordinarily memorable stories of both bravery and brutality. To me, the novel's main weakness is the love story.  The protagonist's love interest, as in all of Hemingway's novels, is young (19 years old, in this case), beautiful, naive, and ignorant.  She worships Robert Jordan, and obeys his every command much as a puppy.  Having no mind of her own, she is wholly contented by serving Jordan in ways such as washing his socks and and drying out his sleeping bag. The only other oddity in the novel is Hemingway's habit of translating Spanish literally.  For example, he uses thou and you to differentiate between the Spanish speaker's use of \"tu\" and \"Usted.\"  He also uses such nonsensical phrases as \"I have much hunger\" as a translation for the Spanish \"tengo mucho hambre,\" and \"What passes with thee?\" for \"Qu te pasa?\".  I found that a bit distracting. On the whole, however, I found the novel remarkable.  Hemingway's ability to pare down complex ideas and events into such simple, powerful prose is unsurpassed.Great at war, so-so at love</td><td>4</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>80000892</td><td>4.0</td><td>true</td><td>A2H96Y7X2GCK72</td><td>B00002N602</td><td>AD</td><td>Great product.

This is a succesfull mix that results in a lot of fun. For most of the game you play as Tarzan, as a adult and as a kid, Terk in the camp level, and the amusing Jane sequence.  The graphics are very good, capturing the spirit of a jungle, with lots of creatures wondering around, light from treetops and lots more.  Disney has always been good in delivering great music that is enjoyable all by itself and Tarzan is no diffrent, with bongos, drums and the themes from the movie. The 3 challenge levels give you a taste of difficulty and a different ending for each one.  The levels are also very cool and neat to play through. Unfortunity Tarzan suffers from some serious problems.  I pretty much gaurantee that you will get very annoyed by the jungle creatures that will try to kill you on your quest for manhood and survival, especially the stupid birds that bombard you with coconuts, and yet, you can never kill them!  What's up with that?! The monkeys are also very annoying  Also, some of the moves can be difficult for young kids to pull off.  The final two levels are really difficult to defeat, and defeating the evil Clayton is really difficult. Overall, Tarzan is a good game that no one should pass up, especially if they want sidescrolling action. The good: Great graphics, nice jungle themes, great music. The bad: Creatures can get VERY annoying And the ugly: Can be really difficult at timesTarzan like game!</td><td>6</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>80000901</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A2I44LL1RPOEN5</td><td>B00002N602</td><td>diegoc</td><td>A gift for my daughter.

For the past year, I have stood by Final Fantasy VII saying that it is the best RPG ever created. I was wrong. It WAS the best RPG ever created in 1997. When FF VII first came out on the PSX it was said to be the best game ever put on the PSX. They were right. When it was released in '97 the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games. The storyline itself was gripping and although it had it's dull moments, it culminated in a spectacular finish. Now I think the reason that most of you think this game sucks is because it has been 7 years, 7 YEARS!! since this game hit the shelves and every year we see new games and flashier graphics. And you DARE compare this game to a PS2 GAME!!!! It's just not fair. The capabilities of the PSX could never, in a million years, rival that of the PS2's capabilities. It's just not gonna happen. Other than that this game is tolerable considering today's standards. But they will never be able to compete with FF VII's soundtrack, it is beyond competition.

Well, for starters, graphics don't make a game, that's why this game sold the most out of any FF game.  And 8 better than 7, HA!

I own FFIV,V,VI,VII,VIII,IX, and X and have beaten FFVII,VIII,IX,and X and this one is the best. I have to recommend it to everyone, RPG fan or not. Squaresoft was at it's prime in this period what with FFVII & Xenogears, my favorite Squaresoft games. The battle format is the tried and true Active form (you have a \"Active Time Battle\" gauge that fills and when it fills, the character can attack. Enemies don't have to wait for you to use your turn to use theirs). There are tons of commands (Ex. Attack, Deathblow, Magic, Item, Morph, Steal, Mime, etc.) but many require Materia to use. Materia is what you insert into your weapon and armors empty Materia slots to gain the Materias ability while it is equipped. You gain AP as well as EXP and Gil ($) after winning a fight. AP levels up your equipped Materia. It is important not to overload your character with Materia though, because as Cloud says in a tutorial, \"It acts as a double-sided sword. While it gives you abilities, it also can subtract from your stats.\" The story starts small as a rebel group AVALANCHE fighting the Shinra Corporation that is turning the only huge city on Gaia, Midgar, into one big industrial market. They are putting up Mako Reactors that suck the energy from the Earth and convert it to power. AVALANCHE destroys a couple of these in missions and Shinra devises a plan. 18 year old Cloud is just joining AVALANCHE, but reluctantly; he is very cruel hearted and troubled do to his past in the beginning, but that changes. Quickly the scheme becomes much more grandiose as Sephiroth gets involved. AVALANCHE falls apart and the core members and a few other characters leave to follow Sephiroth, while Shinra searches for \"the Promised Land,\" a land with tons of Mako energy. The story is serious. A main character even dies at the climax of the first disc. It leads you through tons of places and aquaints you with many people. Of course the ever popular Biggs and Wedge return, as does Cid (you may not get this if you aren't big for Final Fantasy games). The Limit Breaks are cool. During battle there is a gauge called Limit Break which fills when you are attacked. When it fills all the way, you can use Limit Breaks which are very strong attacks. You learn new ones by using previous ones or a variety of other ways for certain characters. The status effects such as Poison or Mute are used. The ammount of Materia is staggering. The summons are great, but one stands out as fairly impossible to not be a one hit kill, besides on Safer Sephiroth if he has on Wall, or Emerald and Ruby Weapon regardless. This summon is common knowledge for Final Fantasy enthusiasts, Knights of the Round, where 13 knights attack the enemies. If you have a good magic stat, they do a good 9000 damage per attack (9000 x 13 = 117,000 damage). The graphics are standout awesome for their time, but nowadays they aren't special and the character designs are a disaster, but again, they were awesome back in the days. The sound is top notch with awesome music. Just like Xenogears, it's one of those few games where I like the music. There are a few huge [disappointments] (the chocobo battle music) and a few instant favorites (the Safer Sephiroth music, \"One Winged Angel\"). The game length is about 40-50 hours, but you'll keep playing it to get to level 99 and complete every last side quest (like me!) and clock in 70 hours if you have one ounce of common sense. The control is flawless except for the X for cancel and Circle for confirm, but that can be fixed with the customizable controls very easily.

It's what rewarded me for waiting and choosing Sony for my new gaming platform. I've been a great fan of their games that followed, especially their landmark success Final Fantasy X for the PS2.

This book is actually fiction with the noble aim of improving the person who is reading it like a self-help book. The book itself centers around the story of a former big-shot lawyer. The lawyer had a self-described wake-up call after a heart attack. This rude awakening led him to sell his possessions and to look for a more meaningful life from certain sages in the East. Of course, the rest of the book is him recounting what he learned. This book has a number of practical suggestions to lower stress and help you feel happier. Things like breathing deeply, living in the present moment, serving others, continually improving yourself, making the most of your time, and taking time out for self-reflection. There are many important lessons about what's really important in life. Is having a big bank account more important than peace of mind? Do fancy cars and clothes bring more happiness than spending quality time with your family and friends? I don't think there's any debate of the value of the message. Who couldn't put these admonishments to good use? I think the real challenge is practicing the techniques described. The book itself even advises that people need to stick with these techniques for at least three weeks till they become habit. One thing that knocked the book a little for me was the cliches. For instance, the cliche of emptying your cup is used in this book. I've read this story of the master who keeps pouring tea into the cup till it's overflowing at least one hundred times. There were some other cliches used that I've also heard plenty of times. This made the book at times seem a little on the cheesy side and a bit unoriginal. Even with these caveats the book still has a lot of practical benefit. For these reasons, I think a person should pick it up if they're looking for inspiration or motivation in their lives.What's Really Important?</td><td>1</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>80000966</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A27OPLCRJTJ131</td><td>0001712845</td><td>PersistantKitty</td><td>Another great book, this entertaining tale was finally destroyed after dozens of children laughed and shared over the years.

What a cliche!  Masterpiece; a term suggesting the undisputed magnum opus of an already venerable company.  Many things gain this mark, but few live up to their expectation.  Final Fantasy 7 does. In many ways, Final Fantasy 7 is far from perfect.  The graphics, compared to today, are dated, grainy, and harsh.  The storyline reeks of cliche-ridden overtones.  The characters seem generic.  However, this is all a product of subsequent games. Final Fantasy 7 defined the 3D graphical engine used in almost all of today's RPGs.  Its characters, still fresh, were very unique, emotionally unstable, and enjoyable to read about.  The storyline spins off numerous tangents and undertones that suggested a fully functioning, realistic world that presents real-life human troubles. This is far from a typical RPG.  From its conception, it redefined the genre and introduced the RPG to about 3 million new gamers.  Saying that Final Fantasy 7 single-handedly elevated RPGs from niche to mainstream status would be far from an erraneous statement. Considering all of these things, a person skeptical about playing Final Fantasy 7 should grant reconsideration.  Though it is far from the prettiest and most unique of games, it does represent the model that all of today's successful RPGs follow.  And, in this case, the model is more radiant than its spinoffs.A masterpiece, of its time.</td><td>5</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>80000968</td><td>4.0</td><td>false</td><td>A3DNOW0NPFTB6E</td><td>0002008599</td><td>M.

The book reveals wisdom to know the real inner spiritual self rathar than the one inundated with materialistic possessions. The Himalyan guru's wis' advice on way,  to Julian Mantle, a high-profile attorney in this fable story, preaches to dig spirituality within self and conveys the message to think that what lies behind you or before you is nothing compared to what is withing your own good inner self. There is the sane advice to create a live of passion, live it purposefully and peacefully. Julian's life was out of balance and his spiritual self is nourished with wise advice on joyful living by developing joyful thoughts, follow life's mission to reach goals, develop relationships fruitfully and live to satisfaction with courage and discipline, come what may!

The plot unfolds throughout the game, picking up its pace toward the end, but not falling prey to the common problem of tying up all the plot threads in two minutes.  It's well-paced, the plot twists arising out of the characters and situations as presented, and nothing really shows up as a deus ex machina (except for the bit with the blasted snake ...) The characters are generally well-developed;  while the three main characters get most of the development, each of the other characters, including the optional ones, get a few scenes with insight into their actions or their pasts.  These characters also have reasons to be working together, rather than just thrown together haphazardly. The female characters are excellent, though Aeris is just a bit TOO perky. The villain is excellent, well-handled and well-developed.  The lesser villains and some of the other NPCs also get a bit of character development (the optional quest in Wutai with the Turks has to be one of my favorite bits in the game), And the villains' actions make sense within the context. The materia system is complicated.  Expect to spend some time fussing with it to understand how it works.  This is not necessarily a negative, mind. The music is great.  From what I understand, it's a distinct departure from the earlier games, but I haven't played them.  There are a few mediocre pieces, such as Honeybee Manor, but the truly excellent pieces, such as the Turks' Theme, Nightmare's Beginning (Vincent's Theme), and One-Winged Angel (final battle music), more than make up for them, and there are no truly annoying God-don't-play-this-song-again pieces in it. The only real problem I have with this game, is that the FMVs can't be skipped (there's only so many times you can watch the thing with the gondola ...) and that the last battle, especially if you've done the optional quests, is too easy.Wonderful</td><td>5</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>80000974</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>AJBZA21X823IN</td><td>0001712845</td><td>Suzanne H</td><td>I recently purchased this book for my 2 1/2 year old grandchild.

First off, the sound is god awful.  Everything from this game sounds like it's coming from a small FM Radio with nearly dead batteries from the other end of a long tunnel.  It's that bad.  Not to mention that there are a few sound glitches where some of the sound effects don't even play for a few moments.  So, for example, you periodically won't hear Ryu yell, \"Hadoken\" for a short period of time.  But the sound doesn't make the game, the controls do.  And that's my next gripe. Unless you are on an Aracde Stick, you'll have a harder time playing this game then you would on a keyboard.  Not only does this game not support the analog stick, but the control pad isn't very responsive at all.  And no, it's not the controller.  I've played KOF 98 and 99, Street Fighter 3: Double Impact, and Soul Calibur 1 all on the same controller.  And I haven't had nearly as many problems with the controls on those games as I've had here.  Not to mention, you have shoulder buttons for the FP and FK.  In MVC2, you won't mind shoulder buttons because that game has a 4 button layout with FP and FK used almost souly for calling the helpers.  MVC1 still has the 6 button layout as its other Capcom brothers.  Meaning a standard Dreamcast controller isn't very suitable for a fast paced game such as this.  Every nanosecond counts in this game and you can't have sluggish shoulder buttons slowing you down.  Street Fighter 3 and Alpha can get away with it, but not this game.  In short, get a Mad Catz Dreampad or some sort of Aracde Stick if you're going to get this game. Single player also gets rather dull pretty quickly.  This game is meant for competition as far as I'm concerned.  Casual players will enjoy this game, but the computer is either very easy or very hard and there isn't much middle ground. On the plus end, the game itself is completely intact from the CPS2 version.  And it even has the added Onslaught Mode after you unlock all the hidden fighters.  It also has a 4 player tag battle mode as well.  And that is probably the main reason to get this game.  I, myself, play 4 player tag battle with MAME on Kaillera all the time and I have a blast.  But for those of you that don't believe in emulation and have 3 friends around, this is just as good. All in all, this is one of those party games that's good for playing at an Anime/Video Game convention, for instance.  And while most people sing praises about MVC2, MVC1 is a very solid and competitive game.  The characters are quite unbalanced.  But it doesn't seem to hinder the game in the least bit.  Sans the small rooster of characters, this can be considered supieror to MVC2 in certain ways.  Pick it up if you have some friends around.  You'll have a blast.Not a picture perfect port.</td><td>5</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>80000987</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A10ATY8QTZ37ND</td><td>0001052292</td><td>Leo Lim</td><td>Consists of a journal by of a fictitious employee at Microsoft who moved on to greener pastures in Silicon Valley when the boom was at its highest.

Gameplay: The gameplay is based on how fast and fun the game has, and how much slowdown the game experiences during play. The gameplay is lighting fast with absolutly no slowdown when I play it unless it is so little and the game is so fast paced that it's not noticeable, and that just makes the game even better. The game is also ultimate fun especially with playing with the younger kids, because the look on their face is priceless and hillarios when you pull off a huge combo with a great character, like Mega-Man for example. SCORE: 5-5 SOUND: Sound score is based upon voice overs, SFX, and music. The music 1st of all is awesome, they use origonal music from origonal games, it starts off with the P1's 1st Character music, like if P1's 1st character is Mega-Man, then it starts off with Mega-Mans Music Used in the game, then after a character is killed the next character to pop up has his/her music played, like if Mega-Man is K.O.ed then the 2nd characters music for that team plays. The SFX rule, they are so good, thats all there is to say. The voice overs are perfect in every way and couldn't be any more precice to the characters. SCORE: 5-5 GRAPHICS: The graphics in this game are so beautiful and unbelievably awesome looking, that you can't even believe why they didn't do this in the earlier vs. games.  If the graphics look this good on the 1st for Dreamcast then they have to look way better on the 2nd for the Dreamcast, and they do.  I definetly have to give the graphics.

I've been a computer geek since childhood and have worked at dot.com startups and videogame companies. I've experienced both the highs and the lows of this realm: from the elation of being part of a hit product to the lonely, grinding monotony of twelve-hour days in front of a computer screen in interminable crunch mode. It's clear that Coupland has some personal experience with the demographic he's writing about, the young, brilliant, socially compartmentalized 90's tech worker (AKA geek) trapped in an unfufilling career, trying to invent a better existance. Via the journal of the central character, Dan, he lovingly brings to life the geek mind, with all its ideosyncracies, obsessions, and tangential ponderings, and frames it with an abundance of 90's pop culture references. The characters are fun, quirky, and bear more than a passing resemblance to people I've known in real life. Coupland engineers enough drama, friendship, and events among the close-knit cohorts to keep the reader turning the pages, as well as plenty of thoughtful, apparently off-the-cuff musings about the effects of technology on modern life, and the book is really a breeze to read. I suggested Microserfs to several non-geek friends, and they enjoyed it greatly. The book does have its weaknesses, though. For one, it's obvious that Coupland is an outsider when it comes to computer technology, which gives some of the book's plot points a false ring. The average reader probably won't notice, but the average Wired reader just might. Also, he sometimes tries to invest his characters with a little too much geek cred, which makes them unconvincing at times (or hard to tell apart). Maybe I don't know enough female techies, but Dusty and Amy seemed particularly unlifelike. Still, I give Microserfs a thumbs up. It's an easy, fun read, and captures the overall spirit of a particular subculture (as well as its angst) at an unique moment in history. It would be interesting if Coupland wrote a \"ten years later\" sequel and we could find out where his characters are in their mid-30s, in the present day (their Lego project probably would have been a failure in the real world). If you like this book (or if you are a geek who was disappointed with it), I highly recommend \"Hackers\" by Steven Levy, a spirited account of the real life computer geek world from the 60s through the early 80s. Levy brings the early computer industry alive in a way that's even more fascinating than fiction.An endearing time capsule of 90's geek life</td><td>3</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>80000991</td><td>5.0</td><td>true</td><td>A3VTQLJ49CMFUZ</td><td>B00002N602</td><td>suzbuz</td><td>Wouldn't be without one of these in the kitchen!

As you get older, the bottom line becomes to survive as best you can.\" -\"It's your world now... it's yours.\" Douglas Coupland is popular with my generation, most likely because he makes keen observations about life from a perspective people of the X Generation can understand and relate to. Heck he must be the expert since he coined the term \"Generation X\". However, he also must appeal to the ME ME ME IT'S ALL ABOUT ME self-centredness that is a part of the nature of most people of this generation. Also it must appeal to their short attention spans and complete irreverence toward just about everything. I recognise that this is a generalisation, and I am not condemning Coupland nor his fans. I am simply saying that Coupland's writing style is idiosyncratic and definitely has one target audience. I read his earlier works, and I enjoyed them more or less, but there is a quality to Coupland's writing that seems very surface and artificial despite his astute and timely observations about people and things. Coupland is genuinely witty in his writing, but most of the time I find that he tries too hard. What I mean by this is that he overreaches for authenticity. For example, in Microserfs, he writes about how he went shopping at the Uwajimaya on 156th in Bellevue. Locals will be impressed that he knows his stuff and people from outside of the greater Bellevue/Redmond/Eastside area will be impressed with his knowledge, or maybe his imagination if they don't know that Uwajimaya is really on 156th in Bellevue. The problem for me, though, is that these little things just go too far by a tiny amount that just push these references right over the thin line of what is clever and what is trying too hard. Maybe just Uwajimaya in Bellevue OR Uwajimaya on 156th. Either/or but not both! Just too many offhand refences to places, landmarks (like the now-imploded Kingdome) and local \"things\" to prove he had actually done his homework or something. I know some people were very impressed by that level of detail, but I found it, once again, artificial. Coupland writes Microserfs like a journal and brings up many interesting points, like how Gen X parents expected their company to take care of them forever and in exchange the employees gave unwavering loyalty. Gen Xers think of almost all jobs as temporary stepping stones to something else. Interestingly, most of what technical talk Coupland included is all pretty out of date considering that the software industry moves like lightning. Most of the interesting observations come in the beginning of the book when the main character is still working for Microsoft. Most of Coupland's references are so dead-on with regard to Microsoft culture and life, which is probably why most Microsofties read it and like it. However, when all the employees move to the Bay Area to work at a start-up, the book completely loses direction and all sense of coherence. The narrator, Dan, discusses his co-workers and their quirks, discusses how he does not understand what exactly the \"Information Superhighway\" is supposed to be and goes off on a tangent about how major freeway construction died around 1975. He notes that only foreign employees at Microsoft seem to smoke, and it is not a surprise that user-friendliness is a West Coast American concept. Later in the book, the observations deteriorate to Dan reporting what his friends have said, such as the reasons why breakfast cereals are \"decadent\" or Karla and other characters discussing how their Barbie dolls had sex lives. Yes the book explores the ever-searching nature of people born in this generation, yes the book examines the culture of Microsoft and can be painstakingly funny in doing so, and yes the book is readable. Is it great? Is it a classic? No. It can be read in a half day for fun, and that should be all you read it for.YES, WELL, YOU GEEKS ARE AN ODD BLEND OF DOORS AND BRAKES.</td><td>1</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>80000997</td><td>4.0</td><td>false</td><td>AJKWF4W7QD4NS</td><td>B00000K10O</td><td>N.

I'm sorry I thought that, because it kept me  from reading this book for far too long.  From the first page, I was  hooked.  I honestly could not put this book down.  On the bus, in the car,  walking down the street, on lunch breaks at work -- I read this book  nonstop until I was finished. It details the lives of several Microsoft  employees who quit the B-B-B-B-BILL culture at Microsoft and move to  Silicon Valley to form a startup tech company.  The opening pages about  Microsoft drew me in, because I work in Redmond WA and a lot of what he  wrote about was very familiar -- and hilarious -- to me. I thought that  the entire book would be that way -- amusing comments about Microsoft  corporate culture -- but after the characters move to the Silicon Valley,  it becomes more introspective, a character study of the lives of these  restless, highly educated, self-named geeks. It's quirky, with lots of  pop culture references, but it's also wonderfully insightful and sweet.  As  I closed the final page, I felt as though I'd had a really moving  experience, and it's not every day that I feel that way after having read a  book. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you're familiar  with tech culture or not.
