# Project-MMA865---Big-Data-NLP
Analyzed dataset containing over 32 million Amazon reviews using PySpark on Databricks platform to determine the helpfulness of a review


Created the model on Azure Databricks using Pyspark
Created NLP pipeline to perform Text Tokenization, Normalization, Lemmatization, TF-IDF Vectorization, POS tagging, N-grams, Word Embedding, and many other things.
Tried Sentiment Analysis and Text Summarization using HuggingFace library
Tried Name Identity Recognition by trying to filter out nouns. Also filtered out qualitative words such as adjectives and adverbs
Tried multiple embedding techniques such as Word2Vec, BERT, etc.
Tried creating custom functions and custom transformers on PySprk to achieve manual Sentence Embedding
Used ML algorithms such as LightGBM, Logistic Regression, ElasticNet, Decision Trees, etc.
Observed outputs such as Regression Coefficients, and Feature Importance from the Decision Tree to understand the importance of features and tokens (words) 
Observed metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1 score to judge model accuracy
Achieved 90% accuracy. 1st rank in the MMA private competition.
